                    <P>Godavari River is known as the Godavari is a river in Central India, rising in Nashik, a district of Maharashtra. It flows in the Deccan plateau and then, to the south of India before it joins the Bay of Bengal The Godavari river rises in the Sahyadris near Trimbakeshwar. It is located around 80 kms away from the Arabian Sea. It flows south-easterly for sound 1,465kms direction through the states of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh before it falls into the Bay of Bengal.
                        The river extends over an area of 3,12,813 kms², which is almost 10% of the area of the country. There are many hills that surround the river on all four sides. The banks of the Godavari river are rich in aluminium soil and are great for agricultural activities.</p></P>

                    <p>Godavari, the Dakshin Vahini Ganga, originates at an elevation of 1067 meters in the Brahmagiri Hills of the Western Ghats in Nashik District of Maharashtra and continues its journey over 1465 kms in the south east to meet the Bay of Bengal at Narasapuram in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh. Like many Indian rivers, Godavari’s origin is consecrated with a Shiva Temple, the Trimbakeshwar, which is also one of the 12 Jyotirlingas (most of them near a river). And like many other rivers, it has an elaborate myth and a hymn in its honour. The river has a sister, Gautami, right at its origin in Maharashtra and again a distributary called Gautami right where the river falls into the sea in Andhra Pradesh!

                        The river mainstem, longest in Peninsular India, travels through three states, Maharashtra, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, while its basin includes Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, parts of Chattisgarh and Odisha. It traverse through 3 agroclimatic zones, 6 agro ecological zones and supports an astounding array of biodiversity and communities. More than 60 million people call Godavari Basin their home. The basin includes important towns like Nashik, Nagpur, Wardha, Nanded and Chandrapur from Maharashtra and Bhadrachalam, Nizamabad, Mancherial & Ramagundam in Telangana, Rajahmundry & Narsapur in Andhra Pradesh and Seoni & Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh.
                
                            The river is considered no less than a sister to Ganga and I remember as a child, elders always referring to Godavari as Ganga. Nashik is important religiously not only as the birth place of this Dakshin Vahini Ganga, where she refused to fall into the Arabian Sea, but also because of the deep association of the city with Ramayana. Nashik was believed to be a part of Dandakaranya where Lord Ram resided for nearly 14 years in Vanavasa. All along the river in places like Tapovan, one can find glimpses of this ancient myth worshipped today. On the banks of Godavari in Nashik also stands the KalaRam Mandir where, in 1930, Babasaheb Ambedkar launched the KalaRam Mandir Entry Satyagraha, storming the temple which was thus far restricted for the depressed classes. Indeed, Godavari has borne witness to several remarkable happenings at her origin itself.
        
        In her middle reaches in Nanded, Takth Sri Hazur Sahib graces the banks of the river where Guru Gobind Singh breathed his last. The place is one of the five holy places in Sikkhism. In Telangana and Andhra too the banks have numerous mosques, temples and ghats of historical significance like Kotilingala in Karimnagar, Telangana, at the confluence of Peddavagu and Godavari. This was the first capital of the Satavahanas circa 230 BC. Most of the important towns in Satavahana era are along the Godavari. Sadly today the Koti Lingala is facing threat of submergence from Sripada Yellampalli Irrigation project. At Dhawaleswaram the river divides into two branches, the Gautami and Vasishta.  Between the two lies the Godavari Central Delta.  The two arms split into branches as they approach the sea dividing the Central Delta into a number of islands.
        Anne Feldhaus sums up the historical legacy of many cultures and religions of this upper Godavari Valley and Marathwada eloquently. She says: “This is the area that Cakradhar, the founder of the Mahanubhav sect (circa 12-13th Century), referred to as the “Ganga valley” that is, the (upper) valley of the Godavari, the northernmost of the great rivers that flow from northwest to southeast across the Deccan Plateau. In Cakradhar’s time, what is now Marathwada was the core of the Yadava kingdom, with its capital at Devgiri (subsequently called Daulatabad). Paithan, the capital of the much earlier kingdom of the Satavahanas (first century B.C.E. to third century C.E.) is also found in Marathwada, on the Godavari river, as is Nanded, the site of the grave of the seventeenth-century Sikh leader Govind Singh. The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb’s city, Aurangabad, is now the principal city of Marathwada in Godavari basin, which is also home to the Buddhist (and Jain and Hindu) caves at Ajanta and Ellora (called Verul in Marathi) and to the major Sufi shrines at Khuldabad.” (From: Feldhaus, Anne, in History of Sacred places in India as reflected in traditional literature, Edited by Hans Bakker, 1990)</p>

                    <p>Godavari is sometimes referred to as the 'Ganga of the South'. After every twelve years, a major bathing festival held is called as Pushkaram held on the banks of the Godavari River. Scores of people take a holy dip in the sacred waters of Godavari to cleanse themselves of all their sins. Some of the well-known personalities who took bath in its holy water include Baladeva 5000 years ago and the saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu 500 years ago.
                        Legends associated with Godavari River As per mythology, Godavari, one of the most sacred rivers of India, is believed to be the sister of Ganga. It is believed to have originated from the "jata" of Lord Shiva, while he was meditating on Mount Kailash.</p>
                        A legend has it that the Sage Gautama lived in the Brahmagiri Hills at Trimbakeshwar with his wife Ahalya. The Rishi kept his stock of rice in a granary. Once, a cow entered his granary and ate up the rice. When the Rishi tried to ward the cow away with Durbha grass, it fell dead. The cow is considered as an extremely holy animal in Hinduism. The Rishi wished to atone for the sin of ‘Gohatya’ - killing a sacred cow. He prayed to Lord Shiva and requested him to divert the river Ganges to purify his hermitage. Lord Shiva was pleased with the Rishi so appeared in his Trimbaka manifestation and diverted the river Ganges to flow past his homestead. Satisfied with the devotion of Sage Gautama, Lord Shiva also gave some water from his Kamandalu. When the waters of the just descended Godavari River flowed over the dead cow, Sage Gautama sprinkled the water Lord Shiva had given him and the dead cow came back to life. Thus, Sage Gautama was redeemed of all his sins. Ganga was brought down to Trimbakeshwar by Sage Gautama, she is known here as Gautami. It is also known as Godavari, since the river helped Gautama to relieve him off ‘Gohatya’.
            It is also believed that a childless woman conceives a child when she drinks the holy waters of the River Godavari.As per another legend, at Panchavati, located in Nashik on the banks of the River Godavari, Lakshman (brother of Rama) had cut off the nose of Surpanakha (Sister of Ravana). Both Rama and Lakshmana are believed to have taken the ritualistic bath in Godavari, upon hearing about the demise of their father, King Dasharatha.
            
            Another legend has it that Sage Gautama was married to the very beautiful Ahalya. Lord Indra upon learning about her beauty had lusted for her. To get closer to her, Lord Indra disguised himself as Sage Gautama and embraced her. Upon seeing this, the angry sage cursed Ahalya to turn into stone and also cursed Lord Indra to a life full of diseases. The curse to Ahalya was later absolved by Lord Rama. After severe and extreme penance, the curse to Lord Indra was absolved when he took a dip in the holy waters of Godavari. The River Godavari was brought down upon the earth to end the curse of Lord Indra.</p>

                    <p>Sripada Yellampalli irrigation project foundation was laid by Former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy on 28 July 2004.

                        The project is designed to utilize about 63 tmc of water at a cost of Rs. 900 crores in the first phase. In the second phase, about 49.5 tmc would be lifted to the upland regions of Karimnagar, Adilabad, Nizamabad, Warangal and Medak districts with 6 TMC water allotted for the NTPC Ramagundam project.[3] After the flood gates are installed, the project could would store about 20 Tmcft of water
                        
                        The project operational requirement is 163 MW power and 469 million KWh of electrical energy annually to pump the water. The project would supply water for NTPC power project reservoir in Ramagundam Mandal in Karimnagar old district (Peddapalli district).[5] It commenced its operations in 2005 near Mamnoor and Yellampalli villages at Ramagundam and mainly supplies drinking water to Ramagundam ,Godavarikhani cities and Hyderabad Capital city.</p>
