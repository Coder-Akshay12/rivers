                    <p>The Tlawng is a river of Mizoram, northeastern India. Its tributaries include the Tut, Teirei and the Ngashih. The city of Aizawl is situated to the east of the Tlawng river. In 2012, a dam (Tlawng Dam) was proposed for the river.The Tlawng River is one of the longest rivers in Mizoram, measuring 234 km in length (Distance) or 185.50 km net displacement (a straight line) (as of 23.9.2015) Between Zobawk village near Lunglei Town to Bairabi (Mizoram Border) It originates in Zopui Hill (Near Zobawk) some 8 kilometres (5 mi) east of Lunglei at an elevation of 1,395 metres (4,577 ft). After the confluence with Tut and Teirei River it eventually enters Cachar District. It is navigable by small boat up to Sairang.

                    <p>In 1890, when the British came to Mizoram, the Tlawng river was the main means of transportation from Silchar. Sairang on the river banks of Tlawng, is the nearest town from Aizawl (about 14 kilometers away). The journey of about 140 Kilometers from Sairang to Silchar used to take about 15–30 days depending upon the season and water level on a flat water boat.

                    <p>The Tlawng River, also known as the Dhaleswari River, holds significant religious importance for the people of Mizoram, a state in northeastern India. This river is revered by the local Mizo communities, and its religious significance is deeply ingrained in their cultural practices and beliefs.In Mizo folklore and mythology, the Tlawng River is often associated with various legends and stories passed down through generations. It is believed to be inhabited by guardian spirits and deities who protect the land and its people. The river is considered sacred, and its waters are believed to possess purifying qualities that cleanse both body and soul.

                        One of the most important religious festivals observed by the Mizos is Chapchar Kut, which celebrates the onset of spring and the promise of a bountiful harvest. Traditionally, during Chapchar Kut, people gather along the banks of the Tlawng River to offer prayers, perform traditional dances, and partake in communal feasts. The festival is a time of joy, thanksgiving, and spiritual renewal, as the community comes together to honor their cultural heritage and give thanks for the blessings of nature.
                        
                        The Tlawng River also plays a central role in various religious ceremonies and rituals conducted by the Mizos throughout the year. From birth ceremonies to weddings and funerals, the river serves as a sacred backdrop for these important life events, symbolizing the cyclical nature of existence and the interconnectedness of all living beings.
                        
                        Moreover, the Tlawng River is often invoked in Mizo prayers and hymns, where it is praised for its life-giving waters and revered as a source of spiritual nourishment. The river's name itself, "Tlawng," holds significance, as it is believed to be derived from the Mizo word for "mother," symbolizing the nurturing and protective qualities associated with the river.</p>

                    <p>Most of the northerly flowing rivers of Mizoram constitute a part of “Barak Basin”. The main river from Mizoram, that
                        feeds the Barak River Drainage System, is the Tlawng River, that flow northward join Barak River in the northern fringe of
                        Mizoram in the Kolasib District. The Barak River feeds Brahmaputra as its left bank tributaries in form of Meghna River. Barak
                        River originates in the Manipur Hills of India, near Mao Songsang. Near its source, the river receives a lot of little hill streams,
                        including the Gumti, Howrah, Kagni, Senai Buri, Hari Mangal, Kakrai, Kurulia, Balujhuri, Shonaichhari and Durduria. It flows
                        west through Manipur State, then turns southwest leaving Manipur and entering Mizoram State.
                        In Mizoram State the Barak flows southwest then veers abruptly north when joined by a north flowing stream and
                        flows into Assam State where it turns westward again near Lakhipur as it enters the plains. It then flows west past the town of
                        Silchar (Assam) where it is joined by the Madhura River. After Silchar it divides into the Surma River and the Kushiyara River
                        and enters Bangladesh. The principal tributaries of the Barak in India are the Jiri, the Dhaleshwari (Tlawng) the Singla, the
                        Longai, the Madhura, the Sonai (Tuirial), the Rukni and the Katakhal.
                        After entering into modern Karimganj District in south Assam, Barak divides in two, with the northern branch being
                        called the “Surma River” and the south

                <div class="text">
                    <p>Lack of Integrated Management: The absence of comprehensive, integrated management approaches for the Tlawng River basin contributes to fragmented decision-making, conflicting interests, and ineffective governance mechanisms. A lack of coordination among various stakeholders, including government agencies, local communities, and civil society organizations, hinders efforts to address complex water-related challenges holistically.
                        Water Pollution: One of the primary concerns for the Tlawng River is water pollution, resulting from both point and non-point sources such as agricultural runoff, industrial discharge, and domestic sewage. Pollutants like chemicals, heavy metals, and organic waste degrade water quality, harm aquatic ecosystems, and pose risks to human health.
