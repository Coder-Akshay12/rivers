                <p>The Koshi River, also known as the "Sorrow of Bihar" due to its historical tendency to cause devastating floods in the Indian state of Bihar, is one of the major rivers of Nepal and a tributary of the Ganges River.The Kosi is 720 km (450 mi) long and drains an area of about 74,500 km2 (28,800 sq mi) in Tibet, Nepal and Bihar. In the past, several authors proposed that the river has shifted its course by more than 133 km (83 mi) from east to west during the last 200 years. But a review of 28 historical maps dating 1760 to 1960 revealed a slight eastward shift for a long duration, and that the shift was random and oscillating in nature.</p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>The history of the Koshi River is deeply intertwined with the ancient civilizations that flourished in the Himalayan region. Archaeological evidence suggests that the fertile floodplains of the Koshi basin were inhabited by early human settlements as far back as the Neolithic period. These early settlers were drawn to the river's abundant water supply and fertile soils, which supported agriculture and sustained livelihoods.As human societies evolved, the Koshi River continued to play a central role in shaping the destiny of the region. The river served as a vital trade route, facilitating the exchange of goods and ideas between the plains of India and the highlands of Tibet. Along its banks, prosperous cities and towns emerged, serving as centers of commerce, culture, and political power.For the indigenous peoples of Nepal and India, the Koshi River holds deep cultural significance, rooted in myth, legend, and religious belief. Revered as a sacred entity, the river is associated with Hindu mythology and folklore, with tales recounting its divine origins and mystical powers. Pilgrimage sites and temples dedicated to the river's deities dot the landscape, serving as focal points of worship and spiritual devotion.</p>

            <p>The Kosi was also called Kausika in Rigveda. It is a major tributary of the Ganges. One major tributary of the Kosi is the Arun, much of whose course is in Tibet. This river is mentioned in the epic 'Mahabharata' as Kausiki. Formerly known as 'Kausiki,' named after the sage Viśvāmitra, who is said to have attained the status of 'Rishi' on the banks of the river. Viśvāmitra was a descendant of the sage Kusika. Viśvāmitra is credited with many well-known Vedic Hymns on the Banks of the Kosi where he had his hermitage – The Mandala 3, the Rigveda, and the Gāyatrī Mantra. The Gāyatrī Mantra is a highly revered mantra based on a Vedic Sanskrit verse from a hymn of the Rigveda (3.62.10).The Kosi is associated with many ancient spiritual stories. It is mentioned in the Bal Kand section of Valmiki Ramayana as the Kausiki who is the form assumed by Satyavati after her death. Satyavati was the elder sister of Viswamitra, descendants of Kushak dynasty. In the Markandeya Purana, the Kosi is described as the primal force. Due to the violent nature of the Kosi during monsoon season, legend says that Parvati, the wife of Shiva, after defeating the demon Durg, became known as the warrior goddess Durga who transformed into Kaushiki. In Ramayana, the river Ganges is depicted as her elder sister. According to Mahabharata epic, the God of death took the form of a woman and resides on the banks of the river to limit population growth. Kosi resonates with the folklore of Mithila. The most important depictions of Kosi folklore are Kosi as a virgin absolutely care free and full of energy and as a frustrated wife of old hermit Richeek wandering in the Himalayas. Kosi is also invoked as the mother – 'Kosi Ma'. These images capture the contradiction that is inherent in the Kosi River as a source of life and death, prosperity and destruction; a mother and an enchanting virgin.It is also the lifeline of the Mithila region, today spread over more than half of India's state of Bihar. It is the subject of legend and folklore of the region; the legend of Mithila extends over many centuries. Mithila is also the name of a style of Hindu art created in the area.</p>

        <h2 class="basin" id="basin">RIVER BASIN</h2>
        <img src="/src/States rivers/bhiar/basin.png" alt="">
        <div>
            <p>The Kosi basin is bounded on the north by the Himalayas, on the east by Mahananda basin, on the west by the Burhi Gandak basin and on the south by the river Ganga.The basin in India Territory extends over areas of districts Saharsa, Purnea, Khagaria, Madhubani, Sitamarhi, Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga in Bihar state. The more important rivers in this basin are kosi (main stem), Kamla Balan Adhwara Group of riversan Bagmati.
                The river Kosi is formed by the confluence of three streams namely the Sun Kosi, the Arun Kosi and Tamur Kosi all taking their origin in the Himalayan region of Nepal and Tibet. After confluence, Kosi flows in narrow gorge for about 10 km and debouches into plains near Chatra. River enters in Indian Territory about 25 km below the Chatra gorge at Hanuman nagar. After that Kosi runs in a sandy track and almost in level plains and finds its way southwards into the River Ganga through a number of channels. The Kosi drains an area of 74,500 sq.km of which only 11,070 sq.km lie within Indian Territory. The Kosi is well known for its tendency to change its course generally in westward direction. During the last 200 years, the river has shifted westwards for a distance of about 112 km and has laid waste large tracks of agricultural land in Darbhanga,Saharsa and Purnea districts. The total catchments area upto its outfall in the River Ganga is 100800 sq.km.Apart from the three streams which form the Kosi, a number of tributaries join the river in course of its flows through the plains from the right bank. These are Trijunga, Bhutahi Balan, Kamla Balan and Bagmati.The Trijunga originates in the foot hills of Himalayas and join Kosi in Nepal having catchments area of 747 sq.km in the hills.The Bhutahi Balan originates in the foot hills of Himalas and out falls in Kosi a few Km below Nirmali having a catchments area of 1,505 sq.km.The River Kamala originates in the Mahabharat range of hills in Nepal at an elevation of 1,200 mt (Latitude 27°15”E). During the course in Nepal, the Kamla receive a number of tributaries like the Chandaha, the Thakur and the Jawakhota. After flowing about 50 km in Nepal the river enters Indian territory at Begraha above Jai Nagar in Madhubani district. It is joined by Souri,Dhewri and Balan. The river thereafter known as Kamla Balan. It flows in southeasterly dfirection and out falls into Kosi near Darjia. The river has a catchments of 2,980 sq.km and length 328 km.Adhwara group of river originates from the foot hills of Nepal. The vast tract of very fertile land in North Bihar lying between river Kamla and Bagmati is known as the Adhwara Sub-Basin. This basin is traversed by a network of river namely Adhwara, Jamura, Sikau, Burhand, Khiroi, Singhi, Marha, Rato Dhaus and Darbhanga Bagmati. After traversing the whole basin inter connected finaly form two distinct drainage channels namly Khiroi and Darbhanga Bagmati. These two also meet just above Ekmighat road bridge. The combined channels flowing southward falls into the river Bagmati just above Hayaghat Railway Bridge. The total catchments area of these rivers is 4,962 sq.km,out of which 2,597 sq.km is in India..</p>

            <p><h3>Oshi Barrage:</h3>
                The Koshi Barrage, located near the Indo-Nepal border, is a key infrastructure project that diverts water from the Koshi River into an extensive network of canals for irrigation purposes. Completed in the mid-20th century during the British colonial period, the barrage regulates the flow of water and provides irrigation to large areas of agricultural land in the Nepalese Terai region and the Indian state of Bihar.

                <h3>Koshi Project (Flood Control and Irrigation):</h3> 
                    <p>The Koshi Project, also known as the Koshi Flood Control Project, is a multi-purpose water management scheme initiated in the mid-20th century to address the recurring floods in the Koshi River basin. The project includes the construction of embankments, spurs, and drainage channels to contain floodwaters and protect agricultural land and human settlements from inundation. Additionally, the project incorporates irrigation canals and channels to divert water for agricultural use during the dry season.</p></p>

            <img src="/src/States rivers/bhiar/kosi flood.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>The Koshi River is notorious for its devastating floods, which occur with alarming frequency and intensity, particularly during the monsoon season. These floods result from a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, glacial melt, and sedimentation, and have significant social, economic, and environmental impacts, causing loss of life, displacement of communities, damage to infrastructure, and loss of agricultural land. Erosion is a major issue in the Koshi River basin, particularly in the upstream areas where the river originates from the Himalayas. Soil erosion threatens agricultural land, infrastructure, and ecosystems, leading to loss of soil fertility, degradation of water quality, and increased sedimentation in rivers and reservoirs.
                Despite the abundance of water resources in the Koshi River basin, water scarcity is a growing concern, particularly during the dry season. Increasing water demand for irrigation, domestic use, and industrial activities, coupled with changing precipitation patterns and climate variability, exacerbates water stress in certain areas, affecting agricultural productivity, ecosystem health, and human well-being.
