                        The Dhansiri is a river of Golaghat District of Assam and the Ch√ºmoukedima District and Dimapur District of Nagaland. It originates from Laisang peak of Nagaland. It flows through a distance of 352 kilometres (219 mi) from south to north before joining the Brahmaputra on its south bank. Its total catchment area is 1,220 square kilometres (470 sq mi).While flowing as the boundary between Karbi Anglong and Nagaland, it flanks a large wilderness very rich in wildlife. On one side is the Dhansiri Reserved Forest and on the other Intanki National Park. It has several types of important wood bearing trees along its bank like Intanki Forest. Dhansari river along with Kapili by headward erosion has completely isolated the Mikir hills from the Peninsular plateau. There are numerous perennially waterlogged swampy region locally known as bils associated with this river.

                    <p>The Dhansiri River Basin harbors rich biodiversity, including diverse flora and fauna endemic to the region. The basin's ecosystems range from tropical rainforests in the upper reaches to grasslands and wetlands in the lower plains. It supports a variety of wildlife, including endangered species such as the Hoolock gibbon, Asian elephant, and Bengal tiger. The river and its tributaries also sustain aquatic biodiversity, with numerous fish species inhabiting their waters.The Dhansiri River Basin supports a predominantly rural population engaged in agriculture, forestry, and allied activities. The fertile plains along the riverbanks are conducive to rice cultivation, which forms the backbone of the local economy. Fishing is another important livelihood source for communities living in proximity to the river. Additionally, the basin's forests provide valuable resources such as timber, bamboo, and medicinal plants, contributing to local livelihoods and economic development.

                    <p>Small Reservoirs and Tanks: Construction of small reservoirs, check dams, and water storage tanks along tributaries of the Dhansiri River could help regulate water flow, store monsoon runoff, and provide water for irrigation during the dry season. These structures contribute to water conservation and improve agricultural resilience to climate variability.</p>

                    <p>The Dhansiri River Basin faces various challenges, including deforestation, soil erosion, water pollution, habitat degradation, and climate change impacts. Human activities such as deforestation for agriculture, logging, and infrastructure development contribute to environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity. Pollution from agricultural runoff, industrial discharge, and domestic sewage further threatens water quality and ecosystem health.
                        <br>
                        Water resources play a vital role in the Dhansiri River Basin, supporting irrigation, drinking water supply, and industrial activities. The river's flow fluctuates seasonally, with monsoon rains replenishing water levels during the wet season and dry spells leading to reduced flows in the dry season. Efficient water management practices, including reservoirs, dams, and canal systems, are essential for optimizing water use and mitigating water scarcity during periods of low rainfall.
