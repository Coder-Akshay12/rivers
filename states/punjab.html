                <p>The Indus River provides key water resources for Pakistan's economy – especially the breadbasket of Punjab province, which accounts for most of the nation's agricultural production, and Sindh. The word Punjab means "land of five rivers" and the five rivers are Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, all of which finally flow into the Indus. The Indus also supports many heavy industries and provides the main supply of potable water in Pakistan.
                    The ultimate source of the Indus is in Tibet, but there is some debate about the exact source. The traditional source of the river is the Sênggê Kanbab (Sênggê Zangbo) or "Lion's Mouth", a perennial spring not far from the sacred Mount Kailash, marked by a long low line of Tibetan chortens. There are several other tributaries nearby, which may form a longer stream than Sênggê Kanbab, but unlike the Sênggê Kanbab, are all dependent on snowmelt. The Zanskar River, which flows into the Indus in Ladakh, has a greater volume of water than the Indus itself before that point.[26] An alternative reckoning begins the river around 300 km further upstream, at the confluence of the Sengge Zangbo and Gar Tsangpo rivers, which drain the Nganglong Kangri and Gangdise Shan (Gang Rinpoche, Mt. Kailash) mountain ranges. The 2011 remeasurement suggested the source was a small lake northeast of Mount Kailash, rather than either of the two points previously used.

        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <img src="/src/States rivers/Punjab des/indus his.jpeg" alt="jammuD">
        <div class="text">
            <p>The major cities of the Indus Valley Civilisation, such as Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, date back to around 3300 BCE, and represent some of the largest human habitations of the ancient world. The Indus Valley Civilisation extended from across northeast Afghanistan to Pakistan and northwest India, with an upward reach from east of the Jhelum River to Ropar on the upper Sutlej. The coastal settlements extended from Sutkagan Dor at the Pakistan-Iran border to Kutch in modern Gujarat, India. There is an Indus site on the Amu Darya at Shortughai in northern Afghanistan, and the Indus site Alamgirpur at the Hindon River is located only 28 km (17 mi) from Delhi. To date, over 1,052 cities and settlements have been found, mainly in the general region of the Ghaggar-Hakra River and its tributaries. Among the settlements were the major urban centres of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, as well as Lothal, Dholavira, Ganeriwala, and Rakhigarhi. Only 40 Indus Valley sites have been discovered on the Indus and its tributaries. However, it is notable that majority of the Indus script seals and inscribed objects discovered were found at sites along the Indus river.Most scholars believe that settlements of Gandhara grave culture of the early Indo-Aryans flourished in Gandhara from 1700 BCE to 600 BCE, when Mohenjo-daro and Harappa had already been abandoned.The Rigveda describes several rivers, including one named "Sindhu". The Rigvedic "Sindhu" is thought to be the present-day Indus river. It is attested 176 times in its text, 94 times in the plural, and most often used in the generic sense of "river". In the Rigveda, notably in the later hymns, the meaning of the word is narrowed to refer to the Indus river in particular, e.g. in the list of rivers mentioned in the hymn of Nadistuti sukta. The Rigvedic hymns apply a feminine gender to all the rivers mentioned therein, except for the Brahmaputra.</p>

        <h2>RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE</h2>
        <img src="/src/States rivers/Punjab des/indus signif.jpeg" alt="jammuD">
        <div class="text">
            <p>The Indus River has been revered as a sacred lifeline by the indigenous peoples of the Indian subcontinent since antiquity. In ancient Vedic texts, the river is mentioned as "Sindhu," symbolizing purity, abundance, and divine blessings. The reverence for the Indus as a goddess reflects the intimate connection between humans and nature, with rituals and ceremonies performed to honor its sacred waters.
                In Hindu mythology, the Indus River is associated with various gods and goddesses, including Saraswati, the goddess of wisdom and learning, and Shiva, the god of destruction and transformation. Legends recount tales of divine beings descending to earth to bathe in the holy waters of the Indus, bestowing blessings and spiritual purification upon devotees.Along the banks of the Indus River, there are numerous pilgrimage sites and sacred shrines revered by Hindus, Buddhists, and Sikhs alike. These sites serve as centers of spiritual devotion and pilgrimage, attracting thousands of devotees who come to seek blessings, perform rituals, and immerse themselves in the sacred ambiance of the river.
                For Sikhs, the Indus River holds special significance as it marks the eastern boundary of the Punjab region, the heartland of Sikhism. Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, is believed to have visited the banks of the Indus during his spiritual journeys, spreading his message of love, equality, and compassion.The religious significance of the Indus River transcends sectarian boundaries, embodying the spirit of cultural harmony and unity amidst diversity. Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and followers of other faiths coexist along its banks, sharing a common reverence for the sacred waters that sustain life and nourish the soul.

        <div>
            <p>The Indus basin lies in four countries: Pakistan, India, China and Afghanistan. The largest portion of the basin, at 47%, lies in Pakistan while India contains the second biggest share at 39%. China and Afghanistan contain the remaining 14%.[3][4] The Indus basin spans the length of Pakistan, constitutes a majority (65%) of its area and forms part of all provinces and territories of the country: Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, with all except Sindh and Balochistan located entirely within the basin. In India, the Indus basin forms less than 14% of the territory but makes up the northwestern part of the country including the states and union territories of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Haryana and Rajasthan, constituting the whole or major portion of all of them except for the last The Indus river in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Spiti, a tributary of the Satluj, in Himachal Pradesh The Indus basin consists of various topographical regions. A large part of the drainage basin is mountainous, and around 40% of its area lies above an elevation of 2,000 m (6,600 ft).[4] The basin can be divided into two wide physiographic divisions: the upper basin consisting of the mountainous regions of the Himalaya, Karakoram, Hindu Kush, Shiwalik, Suleiman and Kirthar ranges; and the lower basin consisting of the Indus plains including the alluvial plains of the Punjab region and Sindh.[5] Most of the basin is arid or semi-arid, with the exception of the Himalayan foothills which receive significant rainfall.</p>

            <p><h3>Indus Basin Irrigation System:</h3>The backbone of irrigation in Pakistan, the Indus Basin Irrigation System is one of the largest contiguous irrigation systems in the world. It comprises a network of canals, barrages, and dams that divert water from the Indus River and its tributaries to irrigate vast tracts of agricultural land in Punjab, Sindh, and other provinces of Pakistan. </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Tarbela Dam:</h3><p>Located on the Indus River in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, the Tarbela Dam is one of the largest earth-filled dams in the world. The dam serves multiple purposes, including irrigation, flood control, and hydroelectric power generation. The reservoir behind the dam, known as Tarbela Lake, provides water for irrigation to millions of hectares of agricultural land in the region.</p>

            <p> The Indus River carries a heavy sediment load due to soil erosion from deforested hillsides, agricultural lands, and construction activities. Excessive sedimentation leads to riverbed aggradation, reduced water storage capacity in reservoirs, and increased flood risk downstream. Sedimentation also affects the functioning of irrigation infrastructure, hydropower projects, and navigation routes in the basin.
