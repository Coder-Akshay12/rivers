                    <p>The Brahmaputra is a trans-boundary river which flows through Tibet (China), Northeastern India, and Bangladesh. It is known as Brahmaputra or Luit in Assamese,Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibetan, the Siang/Dihang River in Arunachali and Jamuna River in Bengali. It is the 9th largest river in the world by discharge, and the 15th longest. It originates in the Manasarovar Lake region, near Mount Kailash, on the northern side of the Himalayas in Burang County of Tibet where it is known as the Yarlung Tsangpo River. The Brahmaputra flows along southern Tibet to break through the Himalayas in great gorges (including the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon) and into Arunachal Pradesh. It enters India near the village of Gelling in Arunachal Pradesh and flows southwest through the Assam Valley as the Brahmaputra and south through Bangladesh as the Jamuna (not to be confused with the Yamuna of India). In the vast Ganges Delta, it merges with the Ganges, popularly known as the Padma in Bangladesh, and becomes the Meghna and ultimately empties into the Bay of Bengal.

                    <p>History 
                        The course of the Brahmaputra River has been changing over time. With the eastward diversion of the Teesta River Brahmaputra was joined by the former opposite Bahadurabad Ghat in Mymensingh district. Until the late 18th century the Brahmaputra flowed past Mymensingh and joined Meghna River. 
                        
                        After the Teesta flood in 1787 the Brahmaputra cut a new channel along the Konai-Jenai and converted it after 1810 into the main stream now known as the Jamuna. Along the lower course of the river the land undergoes constant erosion. The upper course of the Brahmaputra was unknown.
                        
                        In 1884-86 the identity of the river with the yarlung Tsangpo was established by exploration. The river is also called Tsangpo-Brahmaputra. With the development of the new channel of the Jamuna in 1987 the course of the Brahmaputra changed. 
                        
                        The course of the lower Brahmaputra earlier was through Jamalpur and Mymensingh districts in Bangladesh. A major earthquake about 250 years ago changed the course of the river into the present flow. The Ganges delta, one of the largest river deltas in the world is fed by the water of the Brahmaputra River.

                    <p>Mount Kailash, the origin of Brahmaputra River is the abode of Lord Shiva and goddess Parvati. The lands and towns along the Brahmaputra River thus attain mythological importance along with the rivers. Koppa Temple at Mansarovar Lake is one of the major visiting spots. Mt. Kailash is claimed to be the summit of the Hindu religious axis, is also one of the highest mountains in Tibet at 22,022 feet. Lord Shiva resides over here among the peaceful Himalayas.

                        A legendary story says that Lord Shiva once built a house for himself but gave it away to a follower who asked for it. Thus without changing his residence he settled in the mountain of Kailash. This is his abode where he stays with his whole family including his wife Goddess Parvati and children Lord Ganesha and Lord Kartikeya and the other Shiv Ganas like Nandi and others. According to ancient religious texts, the abode of Lord Vishnu is called Vaikuntha, the abode of Lord Brahma is called Brahamaloka and the abode of Lord Shiva is called Kailash. The Brahmaputra River originates from the Kailash. Of the three, one can only go bodily and return in this life from Kailash having experienced spirituality. The Hindus, Bons and Jains all travel to this place as pilgrims. A journey to Kailash along River Brahmaputra is considered as once in a lifetime accomplishment.
                        
                        It is because of Kailash - Manasarowar, the river Brahmaputra is considered a religious or holy river. The Manasarowar Lake is 865-kms from Delhi, that Kumaon is sometimes called "Manaskhand". Many myths are associated with this unusual mountain and lake and its flowing river. The Buddhists, the Jains and the Bonpas of Tibet too, all respect this river with great fervor and devotion. Therefore, it is not surprising for a devotee to come across the worlds. The Bonpas make an anti-clockwise pilgrimage around Mt. Kailash after a short worship to River Brahmaputra, whereas the believers of the Jain faith specially visit astpaad near the southern region of Kailash in the Kailash --Mansarover region.
                        
                        Among the thousands of deities of Hinduism, Lord Shiva is the most beloved and the most sought after lord. Lord Shiva finds a great place in the heart of all devotees be it the Human beings, the Devataas or the Rakshasaas and he is directly related to the River Brahmaputra. He is even called Bhola Baba because of his uniqueness of being simple and he grants whatever the devotee asks for. This is the reason why he is having a large number of devotees in all the 3 worlds of Akash, Bhumi, & Patal. Bhola Baba filled with Vairagya or dispassion is a joy of all spiritual seekers.

                    <p>Area of Brahmaputra basin is 580,000 sq.km. which covers China (50.5%), India (33.6%), Bangladesh (8.1%) and Bhutan (7.8%). Length in India is 916km Brahmaputra basin spans states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal, Meghalaya, Nagaland and the whole of Sikkim in India.
                        The basin is of irregular shape: the maximum east-west length is 1,540 km and the maximum north-south width is 682 km. The basin lies between 23°N to 32° N latitude and 82°E to 97°50’ E longitude. The part of the Tibetan plateau falling under the basin has an elevation varying from 3,000 to 5,000m and is dotted with numerous glaciers. Brahmaputra catchment is the heaviest rainfall region in the world. Brahmaputra basin, particularly the portions in Assam, is  prone to annual floods and river bank erosions. Parts of the Himalayan Mountains region of Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh falling in Brahmaputra basin experience snow cover. As per India WRIS data, Brahmaputra basin represents the greenest part of India, accounting for the maximum 55.48% (107854.26 sq.km.) of country's forest cover. In the middle reach of Brahmaputra River is "Majuli", the river island in Assam which is marked as the largest mid river delta system in the world by UNESCO. The hydroelectric potential of the Brahmaputra basin has been assessed 66065 MW.

                    <p>The Brahmaputra River is a powerful erosional force, especially during periods of high flow. Erosion along the riverbanks and in the surrounding areas leads to loss of agricultural land, displacement of communities, and changes in the river's course. Soil erosion also contributes to sedimentation downstream, affecting water quality, navigation, and the health of riverine ecosystems. The Brahmaputra River is notorious for its devastating floods, particularly during the monsoon season. Heavy rainfall in the Brahmaputra basin and its tributaries, combined with glacier melt and upstream dam releases, leads to massive inundation of agricultural lands, displacement of communities, loss of lives, and damage to infrastructure. Flood management strategies are crucial to mitigate these risks and protect vulnerable populations.</p>
