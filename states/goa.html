                    <p>The Malaprabha River is a tributary river of the Krishna River and flows through the state of Karnataka in India. It rises in the Western Ghats at an altitude of 792.4 meters in the Sahyadri hillrange in the state’s Belgaum district.This part of the Western Ghats is located in the west of Jamboti village at a distance of sixteen kilometers in Khanapur taluk in the Belgaum district of Karnataka After flowing in the east and then in the northeast direction, the river finally joins the Krishna River at Kudala Sangama in Bagalkot district of Karnataka. It flows for a distance of 304 km and joins the Krishna river at an altitude of 488 meters near Kudal Sangam in Bagalkot district in Karnataka It also flows through Dharwar District. Hubli city gets the drinking water from this reservoir.Its catchment area is 11549 square kilometers.Tributaries: Bennihalla, Hirehalla and Tuparihalla are the major tributaries to Malaprabha.Reservoir: The Navilateertha Dam (Navil in Kannada means peacock) is constructed near Munavalli in Belgaum District with a storage capacity of 1.07 km3. It irrigates more than 2,000 square kilometres of land. This reservoir is called Renukasagar.

                    <p>Belgaum is the Divisional Head quarter of North Karnataka The ancient name of the town of Belgaum was Venugrama, meaning Bamboo Village. It is also called as Malnad Pradesh.The most ancient place in the district is Halsi; and this, according to inscriptions on copper plates discovered in its neighborhood, was once the capital of a dynasty of nine Kadamba kings. It appears that from the middle of the 6th century to about 760 the area was held by the Chalukyas, who were succeeded by the Rashtrakutas. After the break-up of the Rashtrakuta power a portion of it survived in the Rattas (875-1250), who from 1210 onward made Venugrama their capital. Inscriptions give evidence of a long struggle between the Rattas and the Kadambas of Goa, who succeeded in the latter years of the 12th century in acquiring and holding part of the district. By 1208, however, the Kadambas had been overthrown by the Rattas, who in their turn succumbed to the Yadavas of Devagiri in 1250. After the overthrow of the Yadavas by the Delhi Sultanate (1320), Belgaum was for a short time under the rule of the latter; but only a few years later the part south of the Ghataprabha River was subject to the Hindu rajas of Vijayanagara. In 1347 the northern part was conquered by the Bahmani Sultanate, which in 1473 took the town of Belgaum and conquered the southern part also. When Aurangzeb overthrew the Bijapur sultans in 1686, Belgaum passed to the Mughals. In 1776 the country was overrun by Hyder Ali of Mysore, but was retaken by the Peshwa with British assistance. In 1818 it was handed over to the British East India Company.In 1836 the southern district continuing to be known as Dharwad, the northern as Belgaum.Kittur in Belgaum district is a place of historical importance. Rani Chennamma of Kittur (1778-1829) is known for her resistance to British rule; another person in the history of Belgaum known for his resistance to British rule is Sangolli Rayanna.There are several names available for Belgaum city. Kannada people call it Belgaavi, Marathi people call it Belgaon, North Indians call it as Belgaum.The British had a sizable infantry post here, having realised the military importance of its geographic location. It is one of the reasons for Belgaum’s sobriquet The Cradle of Infantry. Development of a rail network for movement of resources and later troops was one of the means employed by both the British East India Company and the British to exert control over India. Belgaum’s railway station, the Mahatma Gandhi Railway Station was established by the British. A signboard declaring the sobriquet can be seen hung on Platform 1 at the station.

                    <p>The Malaprabha River basin covers an area of approximately 20,000 square kilometers, with its headwaters originating in the Western Ghats near the Belagavi district of Karnataka. The river flows in a southeasterly direction through the Deccan Plateau before joining the Krishna River near the town of Kudalasangama in Karnataka.The Malaprabha River basin is fed by several tributaries, including the Hirehalla, Ghataprabha, and Tungabhadra rivers. These tributaries contribute to the flow of water and help sustain the river's ecosystem and the livelihoods of communities dependent on it.

                        Agriculture: The fertile plains of the Malaprabha River basin support intensive agriculture, with a variety of crops grown in the region, including sugarcane, paddy, maize, and cotton. The availability of water from the river and its tributaries through irrigation projects has facilitated agricultural development and economic growth in the basin.The Malaprabha River and its tributaries serve as important water resources for drinking, irrigation, industrial, and hydropower purposes in the region. The construction of dams, reservoirs, and canals has helped regulate water flow, manage floods, and provide water for irrigation to agricultural lands in the basin.

                    <p>Upper Krishna Project (UKP): The Upper Krishna Project is one of the major irrigation projects in Karnataka, which includes the construction of dams, canals, and reservoirs to utilize the waters of the Krishna River and its tributaries, including the Malaprabha River. The Almatti Dam, a key component of the UKP, diverts water from the Krishna River to the Malaprabha River through the Almatti Canal, providing irrigation water to agricultural lands in the Malaprabha basin.

                        Lower Krishna Project (LKP): The Lower Krishna Project is another irrigation project in Karnataka, which involves the construction of dams, barrages, and canals to harness the waters of the Krishna River and its tributaries for irrigation and other purposes. The Narayanpur Dam, located on the Malaprabha River, is a part of the LKP and supplies water for irrigation to the Malaprabha command area.</p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>One of the primary issues affecting the Malaprabha River is water pollution. Industrial effluents, agricultural runoff containing pesticides and fertilizers, untreated sewage, and solid waste disposal contribute to high levels of contamination in the river. This pollution not only degrades water quality but also poses risks to aquatic life and public health downstream.Over-extraction of water from the Malaprabha River for irrigation, industrial, and domestic purposes leads to reduced flow, especially during dry seasons. This affects downstream water availability, aquatic habitats, and the overall ecological health of the river.</p>
