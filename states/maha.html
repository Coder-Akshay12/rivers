                    <p>The Krishna River is the fourth-biggest river in terms of water inflows and river basin 
                        area in India, after the Ganga, Godavari and Brahmaputra. The river is almost 1,400 
                        kilometres (870 mi) long. The river is also called Krishnaveni. It is one of the major 
                        sources of irrigation for Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.[3
                        The Krishna river originates in the Western Ghats near Mahabaleshwar at an 
                        elevation of about 1,300 metres (4,300 ft), in the state of Maharashtra in central 
                        India. It is one of the longest rivers in India. The Krishna river is around 1,400 
                        kilometres (870 mi) in length (282 kilometres (175 mi) in Maharashtra).
                        The river's source is at Mahabaleshwar near Jor village in the extreme north of Wai
                        Taluka, Satara District, Maharashtra in the west and empties into the Bay of Bengal 
                        at Hamasaladeevi (near Koduru) in Andhra Pradesh, on the east coast. It flows 
                        through the state of Karnataka before entering Telangana State. The delta of this 
                        river is one of the most fertile regions in India and was the home to ancient 
                        42 Satavahana and Ikshvaku Sun Dynasty kings. Vijayawada is the largest city on the 
                        Krishna.

                <div class="text">
                    <p>The regions along the banks of the Krishna River have been inhabited since ancient times. Archaeological evidence suggests that the area was home to several ancient civilizations, including the Harappan and Vedic cultures. The river valley provided fertile lands for agriculture, supporting the growth of urban centers and trade routes. In Hindu mythology, the Krishna River is revered as a sacred river associated with Lord Krishna, an incarnation of the god Vishnu. According to legend, the river is named after Lord Krishna, who is said to have performed divine acts and miracles along its banks during his childhood. The river is mentioned in various Hindu scriptures and epics, further highlighting its religious significance.The Krishna River basin was historically home to several powerful kingdoms and dynasties, including the Satavahanas, Ikshvakus, and Rashtrakutas. These kingdoms flourished along the river valley, establishing prosperous cities, building irrigation systems, and fostering cultural and intellectual advancements.Hydraulic Engineering: The Krishna River basin has a long history of hydraulic engineering and water management. Ancient rulers constructed intricate networks of canals, reservoirs, and dams to harness the river's waters for irrigation, agriculture, and urban development. The construction of these water management systems played a crucial role in supporting the region's economy and livelihoods.During the colonial period, the Krishna River basin came under the control of various European powers, including the British East India Company. The British implemented several irrigation projects and infrastructure developments aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity and facilitating transportation and trade along the river.In the post-independence era, the Indian government initiated large-scale water management projects in the Krishna River basin to address water scarcity, promote agricultural growth, and generate hydroelectric power. Major dams such as the Srisailam Dam, Nagarjuna Sagar Dam, and Tungabhadra Dam were constructed, transforming the hydrology of the region and supporting its economic development.
                The Krishna River basin is also the subject of various interstate water disputes between the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh. Disputes over water sharing, dam construction, and irrigation allocations have led to legal battles and political tensions among the riparian states.Overall, the history of the Krishna River reflects the complex interplay of human activities, environmental dynamics, and socio-political forces that have shaped the development of the region over millennia. From ancient civilizations to modern water management challenges, the Krishna River continues to play a central role in the lives and livelihoods of millions of people in South India.

                    <p>According to Hindu mythology, the Krishna River is associated with Lord Krishna, one of the most revered and beloved deities in Hinduism. Lord Krishna is said to have spent his childhood on the banks of the Yamuna River, a tributary of the Ganges, but he later moved to the banks of the Krishna River, where he spent most of his adult life.

                        The Krishna River is thus considered the sacred abode of Lord Krishna, and many pilgrims visit the river to seek his blessings and to perform various religious rituals. The river is also associated with several other deities, including Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu, and is considered a symbol of the divine feminine.
                        
                        In addition to its spiritual significance, the Krishna River also plays a vital role in the economy and ecology of the region. The river is used for irrigation, hydroelectric power generation, and fishing. The river also supports a diverse array of flora and fauna, including several endangered species.
                        
                        The Krishna River has been the subject of many spiritual and cultural traditions over the centuries. Here are some of the key aspects of the river's spiritual significance</p>

                    <p>The Krishna Basin extends over an area of 258,948 km2 (99,980 sq mi) which is nearly 8% of the total geographical area of the country. This large basin lies in the states of Karnataka (113,271 km2), Telangana, Andhra Pradesh (76,252 km2) and Maharashtra (69,425 km2). It is the fifth largest basin in India.Most of this basin comprises rolling and undulating country, except for the western border, which is formed by an unbroken line of the Western Ghats. The important soil types found in the basin are black soils, red soils, laterite and lateritic soils, alluvium, mixed soils, red and black soils and saline and alkaline soils. An average annual surface water potential of 78.1 km3 has been assessed in this basin. Out of this, 58.0 km3 is utilizable water. Culturable area in the basin is about 203,000 km2 (78,000 sq mi), which is 10.4% of the total cultivable area of the country. As the water availability in the Krishna river was becoming inadequate to meet the water demand, Godavari River is linked to the Krishna river by commissioning the Polavaram right bank canal with the help of Pattiseema lift scheme in the year 2015 to augment water availability to the Prakasam Barrage in Andhra Pradesh.The irrigation canals of Prakasam Barrage form part of National Waterway 4. The Krishna-Godavari delta known as "Rice Granary of India.

The project involves lifting water from the Srisailam Reservoir and diverting it to the upland areas of the Rayalaseema region for irrigation. It aims to provide irrigation water to drought-prone areas and enhance agricultural productivity in the region.</p>
