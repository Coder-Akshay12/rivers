                    <p>The Sabarmati river is one of the major west-flowing rivers in India. It originates in the Aravalli Range of the Udaipur District of Rajasthan and meets the Gulf of Khambhat of Arabian Sea after travelling 371 km (231 mi) in a southwesterly direction across Rajasthan and Gujarat. 48 km (30 mi) of the river length is in Rajasthan, while 323 km (201 mi) is in Gujarat. 
                        The catchment area of the Sabarmati basin is 21,674 km2 (8,368 sq mi) out of which 4,124 km2 (1,592 sq mi) lies in Rajasthan State and the remaining 18,550 km2 (7,160 sq mi) in Gujarat.[4] The basin is located in a semi-arid zone with rainfall ranging from 450 to 800 mm (18 to 31 in) in different parts of the basin.[5] The river traverses three geomorphic zones: rocky uplands, middle alluvial plains, and lower estuarine zone. 
                        The major tributaries are the Watrak, Wakal, Hathmati, Harnav, and Sei rivers. Average annual water availability in the Sabarmati basin is 308 m3 (10,900 cu ft) per capita, which is significantly lower than the national average of 1,545 m3 (54,600 cu ft) per capita.[8] The Sabarmati is a seasonal river whose flows are dominated by the monsoon, with little or no flows post-monsoon.[5] An verage flow of 33 m3 (1,200 cu ft) per second was measured at Ahmedabad during the period 1968-1979. Over the past century, the flood of August 1973 is considered to be the largest flood, when a flow of 14,150 m3 (500,000 cu ft) per second was measured at Dharoi.

                    <p>Rajashekhara's Kavya-mimamsa (10th century) calls the river Shvabhravati (IAST: Śvabhravatī). The 11th century text Shringara-manjari-katha calls it "Sambhramavati" (literally, "full of fickleness").
                        Jain Acharya Buddhisagarsuri has written many poems about the Sabarmati river.
                        During India's independence struggle, Mahatma Gandhi established the Sabarmati Ashram as his home on the banks of this river.
                        In 2018, an assessment by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) named the Kheroj-Vautha stretch of the Sabarmati among the most polluted river stretches in India.

                    <p>In Rajasthan, it is believed that the Sabarmati River originated due to the penance of ascetic Kashyapa on Mount Abu.His penance had pleased Shiva and in return, Shiva gave ascetic Kashyapa the Ganges River. The Ganges River flowed from Shiva's hair onto Mount Abu and became the Sabarmati River.In another legend surrounding the origin of the river, Shiva brought the goddess Ganga to Gujarat and that caused the Sabarmati to come into being.</p>

                    <p>Complete Automation of Lower Jhelum Hydro Project is one of our several projects with Jammu & Kashmir State Power Development Corporation in J&K which is located in Northern part of India. Scope Includes Design, Engineering, Supply, Installation, Testing and Commissioning of Dual Channel Digital Excitation System, Numerical Protective Relay and Control, Micro Processor based Digital Governor System SCADA system, few M_BOP items including dismantling of existing equipment. The conditions of all the existing equipment are very bad also due to very old and outdated technology and to replace them with the latest and state of art technology is what FLOVEL is going to do. Since site conditions are tough hence the whole work needs a proper strategy and expertise – for which FLOVEL is known and the reason chosen by JKSPDC. Our technical experts are well aware of technical challenges to complete this work and ways to complete the work within the challenging scheduled time in order to avoid generation loss.

                    <p>That these treatment plants are urgently needed is not in doubt. The concentration of nitrate-nitrogen in the river has increased from 185 to 672μgL−1, indicating an increase of 260% over the years, reveals a study, ‘Massive land system changes impact water quality of the Jhelum River in Kashmir Himalaya’ published by Shakil Roomshoo, Irfan Rashid and others, assessing changes in water quality from 1983 to now.

                        This, according to the study, has happened due to the combined impact of urbanization, reckless application of pesticides and fertilizers, forest degradation and deforestation. The study adds that aquatic vegetation in lakes and wetlands has gone up by 110% during the past four decades, thereby affecting the health of socio-economically and ecologically important ecosystems.
                        
                        While settlements have shown a 397% increase in the observation period, 18% of the forested area in Jhelum’s catchment has degraded into sparse forest or scrublands from 1972 to 2010. Areas under croplands have decreased by 24% as people shifted from irrigation-intensive agriculture to orchard farming.</p>
