                    <P>The Hooghly River (Hugli; Anglicized alternatively spelled Hoogli or Hugli) or the 
                        Bhāgirathi-Hooghly, originally and in local tongues the 'Ganga', and also called 
                        Kati-Ganga, is an approximately 260-kilometre-long (160 mi) distributary of the
                        Ganges River in West Bengal, India. The Ganges splits into the Padma and the 
                        Hooghly near Giria, Murshidabad. Today there is a further man-made bifurcation of 
                        the river upstream at Farakka. The Padma flows eastward into Bangladesh, whereas 
                        the Hooghly flows south through West Bengal. The river flows through the Rarh 
                        region, the lower deltaic districts of West Bengal, and eventually into the Bay of 
                        Bengal. The upper riparian zone of the river is called Bhagirathi while the lower 
                        riparian zone is called Hooghly. Major rivers that drain into the Bhagirathi-Hooghly 
                        include Mayurakshi, Jalangi, Ajay, Damodar, Rupnarayan and Haldi rivers other 
                        than the Ganges. Kolkata and Hugli-Chinsura, the headquarters of Hooghly 
                        (district), are located on the banks of this river</P>

                <img src="/src/States rivers/west bengal/h h.webp">
                <div>
                    <p>he Ganga is one of the three major rivers which constitutes the Great Plain of India through depositional activities. In its lower course, near Dhuliyan in Murshidabad, the Ganga has bifurcated into two channels – one towards the south and another towards the south-east. The southern flow is named ‘Bhagirathi’ which ends at Bay-of-Bengal near Sagar Island and the other flow is named ‘Padma’ which meets the Bay-of-Bengal after passing through Bangladesh.

                        According to mythology, Bhagirathi is not a natural river but it was excavated by Bhagirath in the days of Mahabharata [1]. The length of Bhagirathi is 520 kms and it is the western boundary of the world’s largest delta. For some unaccountable reason, the name of the river Bhagirathi had been anglicized into ‘Hugli’ [2]. The name Hugli is derived from hogla (aquatic marshy plant) reeds [3]. Hugli River has three distinct sections, the upper section from the point of bifurcation near Dhuliyan in Murshidabad to its confluence with Jalangi river in Nadia, the central section from Nadia to the confluence with Rupnarayan and the lower one up to the sea. The central portion is nearly 193 kms, out of which approximately 80 kms of the river form the eastern boundary of the Hooghly district [4]. The Hugli River carries both the icemelt water from the Himalayas and the rain-fed streams’ water from the Chhotangpur Plateau region.
                        
                        Under government regulation in 1795, the Zilla Burdwan was divided into two parts, each under a separate officer. The northern part was Burdwan and the southern part was Hooghly [5]. Again Howrah was separated from Hooghly in 1843. So the long tract of the Hugli River is accompanying the district at its eastern margin from Guptipara in the north to Bally Khal in the south. From the colonial period, the river Hugli formed a great water-street which carried the overflowing wealth and population of Calcutta to the villages along its banks [6]. It became the lifeline of the region in such a way that it was not merely a drainage system but also a way to boost the economy, transportation, and even the happiness of uncountable people. It is worth mentioning here that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore acknowledged some unforgettable evenings at the riverbank in Chandernagore to be among the best moments of his life in a letter he wrote to Shrimati Indira Devi from Shilaidaha</p>

                <h1>RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE</h1>
                <img src="/src/States rivers/west bengal/ho sig.jpeg">
                <p>Flowing through the heart of West Bengal, India, the Hooghly River emerges not only as a lifeline for millions but also as a sacred conduit of spirituality and devotion deeply woven into the fabric of Hindu religious beliefs. Originating as a distributary of the revered Ganges River, the Hooghly holds profound religious significance, shaping rituals, festivals, and cultural practices that resonate with the faithful along its banks.

                    At the core of the Hooghly's religious importance lies its association with the mighty Ganges, often regarded as the holiest of rivers in Hinduism. The Hooghly, as a tributary, carries the sanctity and blessings of the Ganges, serving as a sacred extension of its divine waters. Hindus believe that bathing in the Hooghly River is akin to immersing oneself in the purifying currents of the Ganges, a transformative act that washes away sins and bestows spiritual renewal upon the devotee.
                    
                    Pilgrimages to the banks of the Hooghly River are a common practice among Hindu devotees seeking solace and spiritual nourishment. Throughout the year, particularly during auspicious occasions and religious festivals, thousands gather along the river's ghats (riverfront steps) to partake in sacred rituals, offer prayers, and perform ceremonial ablutions. The river becomes a focal point for devotion, where devotees express their reverence and seek blessings from the divine.
                    
                    One of the most prominent events that underscores the religious significance of the Hooghly River is the Ganga Sagar Mela, an annual pilgrimage held at Sagar Island where the river meets the Bay of Bengal. During this time, millions of pilgrims from across India converge at the confluence to bathe in the holy waters and perform rituals in homage to their ancestors. The festival epitomizes the spiritual connection between humanity and the sacred waters of the Hooghly, reaffirming the river's role as a source of spiritual rejuvenation and transcendence.
                    
                    Moreover, the Hooghly River serves as a sacred site for cremation and the immersion of ashes, a solemn ritual deeply rooted in Hindu tradition. Families gather along the riverbanks to bid farewell to their departed loved ones, believing that the waters of the Hooghly carry the souls of the departed on their journey towards moksha (liberation). The act of releasing ashes into the river symbolizes the cyclical nature of life and death, offering solace and spiritual comfort to the bereaved.
                    
                    Alongside these rituals and ceremonies, the Hooghly River is also home to numerous temples, shrines, and sacred sites that attract devotees and pilgrims throughout the year. These places of worship serve as sanctuaries of faith and devotion, where devotees pay homage to their chosen deities and seek blessings for prosperity and well-being.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>The Bhagirathi-Hooghly Basin in India is one of the most densely populated regions in the world and is undergoing rapid transformation of its natural landscape induced by human interventions, such as mushrooming of dams and barrages, deforestation, and urbanization. Human activities and interventions on basin landforms and the processes that shape those landforms have accelerated at an alarming rate. This book uses spatio-temporal analysis to understand the major anthropogenic signatures on land use and land cover changes and the impact these activities have on the landforms and processes of the Bhagirathi-Hooghly River and its sub-basins. It answers the what, where, why, and how of the anthropogenic signatures involved. Recent case studies on the impact of anthropogenic signatures on fluvial forms and processes make this book a useful resource for students and researchers in the earth sciences, local governments, urban planners, and all concerned with rural developments.</p>

<br>

<p>The Hooghly River carries a heavy sediment load due to soil erosion in its catchment area. Sedimentation reduces the river's water-carrying capacity, increases the risk of flooding, and affects navigation. Dredging and riverbank erosion control measures are needed to manage sedimentation and maintain the navigability of the river.

    Despite being a distributary of the Ganges, the Hooghly River basin experiences water scarcity, particularly during the dry season. Over-extraction of water for irrigation, industrial use, and domestic consumption, combined with inadequate water management practices, exacerbates water scarcity issues. Sustainable water management strategies, including water conservation, rainwater harvesting, and efficient irrigation techniques, are essential for addressing water scarcity in the basin.</p>
