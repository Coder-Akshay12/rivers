                        The Imphal River (Meitei: Imphal Turel), also known as the Turel Achouba, is a major river in Manipur state, northeastern India which originates from the northern side of Kangpokpi district. It is a tributary of the Manipur River, joining it in Thoubal district. It flows past Loktak Lake and the city of Imphal and joins the Lilong River, some 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) to the south. It flows towards Myanmar (Burma), marking the end point at 23°59'49.2"N 93°44'29.7"E. It then goes south meeting Myittha River at 22°53'24.19"N, 94° 5'1.79"E. Myittha river flows towards north and meets Chindwin River (also called as Ningthi River) at 23°11'36.82"N, 94°18'38.28"E. Chindwin river then meets Irrawaddy River at 21°25'23.85"N, 95°16'47.56"E. Irrawaddy river then flows south till it ends at Andaman Sea, adjoining the Bay of Bengal and thereby connecting Imphal city to the sea. Imphal River was used by Japanese soldiers in boats to reach Imphal in World War II.

                    <p>The Imphal River basin has been inhabited for thousands of years, with evidence of human settlements dating back to ancient times. The river served as a lifeline for early inhabitants, providing water for drinking, irrigation, and other daily needs. The fertile plains along the riverbanks supported agriculture, trade, and commerce, contributing to the socio-economic development of the region.During the colonial period, the Imphal River basin came under the influence of various external powers, including the British East India Company. The British established administrative control over Manipur, leading to significant socio-political changes in the region. The river served as a means of transportation and communication, facilitating colonial administration and trade.The Imphal River basin gained prominence during World War II when it became the site of major battles between the Allied and Axis forces. The Battle of Imphal and the Battle of Kohima, fought in 1944, were crucial turning points in the war in the Eastern Theater. The river valley served as a strategic location for military operations and supply lines, with the Imphal River playing a significant role in logistics and transportation.After India gained independence in 1947, the Imphal River continued to play a vital role in the socio-economic development of Manipur. The river and its tributaries support agriculture, fisheries, and hydropower generation, contributing to the livelihoods of local communities. The construction of dams, reservoirs, and irrigation projects has further enhanced the river's importance for water resource management and sustainable development.

                <div class="text">
                    <p>The Imphal River basin lacks integrated management and governance mechanisms to address the various challenges it faces. Fragmented approaches to water resource management, inadequate infrastructure, and limited coordination among stakeholders hinder efforts to conserve and sustainably manage the river's resources. Illegal sand mining along the banks of the Imphal River contributes to habitat degradation, erosion of riverbanks, and disruption of aquatic ecosystems. Unregulated extraction of sand destabilizes riverbeds, alters natural flow patterns, and increases the risk of flooding and erosion, posing threats to both human settlements and the environment.</p>
