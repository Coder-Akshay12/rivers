                <p>he Subernarekha basin extends over States of Jharkhand, Odisha and comparatively smaller part in West Bengal having a total area of 29,196 Sq.km with a maximum length and width of about 297 km and 119 km. It lies between 85°8’ to 87°32’ east longitudes and 21°15’ to 23°34’ north latitudes. Situated in the north-east corner of the Peninsular India, the basin is bounded by the Chhotanagpur plateau on the north and the west, by the ridges separating it from Baitarani basin on the south, by the Bay of Bengal on the south-east and by the Kasai Valley of Kangsabati River on the east. The Subernarekha and the Burhabalang forms the major river systems in the basin. The Subernarekha River rises near Nagri village in the Ranchi District of Jharkhand at an elevation of 600 m. It flows for a length of 395 km before outfalling into the Bay of Bengal. Its principal tributaries joining from right are the Kanchi, the Karkari and the Kharkai. The Burhabalang rises from south of Similipal village in the Mayurbhanj district of Odisha at an elevation of about 800 m and flows for a length of 164 km and drains into the Bay of Bengal. The major part of basin is covered with agricultural land accounting to 53.76% of the total area and 2.39% of the basin is covered by water bodies. The basin spreads over 13 parliamentary constituencies (2009) comprising 5 of Jharkhand and 4 each of Odisha and West Bengal.</p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>The history of the Subarnarekha River dates back to antiquity, with evidence of human habitation along its banks dating to prehistoric times. Archaeological excavations have unearthed traces of early settlements, indicating the presence of ancient civilizations that thrived in the fertile river valley. These early settlers relied on the Subarnarekha for sustenance, water, and transportation, laying the foundations for a vibrant cultural landscape.Throughout history, the Subarnarekha River served as a vital artery of trade and commerce, connecting inland regions with coastal ports and facilitating the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures. Traders and merchants plied their boats along its waters, transporting timber, minerals, and agricultural produce to markets downstream and to coastal trading centers, contributing to the prosperity of the region.With the arrival of European colonial powers in the Indian subcontinent, the Subarnarekha River became a focal point of colonial interest, as the British East India Company sought to exploit its resources for economic gain. Colonial administrators conducted surveys and feasibility studies for river navigation, irrigation, and mining projects along its banks, leading to the establishment of settlements, trading posts, and administrative outposts in the region.</p>

            <p>The Subarnarekha River basin encompasses vast stretches of terrain across the states of Jharkhand, West Bengal, and Odisha. The river originates in the Chota Nagpur Plateau of Jharkhand, meandering through rugged hills, dense forests, and fertile plains before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. Its tributaries, including the Kharkai and the Damodar rivers, contribute to the basin's hydrological network, shaping its landscape and ecosystem dynamics.The Subarnarekha River basin harbors a rich diversity of flora and fauna, with its forests, wetlands, and riparian habitats providing vital ecosystems services. The region is home to a myriad of plant and animal species, including endemic species such as the Mahseer fish and the Chotanagpur terrapin. Wetlands along the riverbanks serve as critical habitats for migratory birds and support local biodiversity.</p>

            <p><h3>Subarnarekha Irrigation Project (SIP)</h3>
                The Subarnarekha Irrigation Project is a multipurpose water management scheme initiated to harness the waters of the Subarnarekha River for irrigation, flood control, and hydropower generation. The project involves the construction of dams, barrages, canals, and reservoirs to regulate the flow of water and provide irrigation to agricultural lands in the basin.</p>

            <p>The Subarnarekha River carries a heavy sediment load due to soil erosion from deforested hillsides and agricultural lands. Excessive sedimentation leads to riverbed aggradation, reduced water storage capacity in reservoirs, and increased flood risk downstream. Deforestation in the catchment area of the Subarnarekha River contributes to soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and habitat degradation. The removal of vegetation exacerbates erosion, increases sedimentation in the river, and disrupts ecological balance, threatening the survival of plant and animal species dependent on the river ecosystem.
