                    <p>The River Jhelum rises from its chief source Verinag at foothills of Pir Panjal ranges in Jammu and Kashmir and flows through a long stretch across the Srinagar and Wular Lake before entering to Pakistan through a deep gorge.Jhelum is lifeline of the city of Srinagar that bifurcate the city into two parts. Over the years, it has emerged as an important tourist destination whether for amusement, accommodation or sightseeing purposes. The Mangla Dam built on the river has been proved as a major tourist attraction. Most of the important lakes including Dal Lake of the city are also fed by the water of Jhelum.The Jhelum River  is a river in the northern Indian subcontinent. It originates at Verinag and flows through the Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir, into Pakistani-administered Azad Kashmir, then the Pakistani province of Punjab. It is the westernmost of the five rivers of the Punjab region, and flows through the Kashmir Valley. It is a tributary of the Chenab River and has a total length of about 725 kilometres (450 mi).

                    <p>The river Jhelum was called Hydaspes (Greek: Ὑδάσπης) by the ancient Greeks. Alexander the Great and his army crossed the Jhelum in BC 326 at the Battle of the Hydaspes River, where he defeated an Indian king, Porus. According to Arrian (Anabasis, 29), he built a city "on the spot whence he started to cross the river Hydaspes", which he named Bukephala (or Bucephala) to honour his famous horse Bucephalus, buried in present-day Jalalpur Sharif. It is thought that ancient Bukephala was near the site of modern Jhelum.[citation needed] According to Gujrat district historian Mansoor Behzad Butt, Bukephalus was buried in Jalalpur Sharif, but the people of Mandi Bahauddin, a district close to Jehlum, believed that their tehsil Phalia was named after Alexander's dead horse, saying that the name Phalia was a distortion of Bucephala. The waters of the Jhelum are allocated to Pakistan under the terms of the Indus Waters Treaty. India is working on a hydropower project on a tributary of Jhelum river to establish first-use rights on the river water over Pakistan as per the Indus Waters Treaty.According to Hindu puranas, the goddess Parvati was requested by the sage Kashyapa to come to Kashmir to purify the land from the evil practices and impurities of the pishachas living there. Parvati assumed the form of a river in the netherworld. Her consort Shiva struck with his spear near the abode of Nila, (Verinag spring). With this stroke of the spear, Parvati emerged from the netherworld. He excavated a ditch measuring one vitasti using the spear, through which the river, originating from the netherworld, came out, and so he gave her the name Vitástā. The ancient Greeks also regarded the river as a god, as they did most mountains and streams. The poet Nonnus in the Dionysiaca calls the Hydaspes a titan-descended god, the son of the sea-god Thaumas and the cloud-goddess Elektra, the brother of Iris, goddess of the rainbow, and half-brother to the harpies, the snatching winds. Since the river is in a foreign country, it is not clear whether they named the river after the god, or whether the god</p>

                    <p>Like the territory of Jammu and Kashmir, Srinagar too has a distinctive blend of cultural heritage. Holy places in and around the city depict the historical cultural and religious diversity of the city as well as the Kashmir valley. Additional structures include the Dastgeer Sahib shrine, Mazar-e-Shuhada, Roza Bal shrine, Khanqah of Shah Hamadan, Pathar Masjid ("The Stone Mosque"), Hamza Makhdoom shrine, tomb of the mother of Zain-ul-abidin, tomb of Pir Haji Muhammad, Akhun Mulla Shah Mosque, cemetery of Baha-ud-din Sahib, tomb and Madin Sahib Mosque at Zadibal.Apart from these, dozens of smaller mosques are located all over the city. Several temples and temple ghats are located on the banks of river Jhelum in Srinagar, including Shurayar temple, Gadhadhar temple, Pratapishwar temple, Ganpatyar Ganesh temple, Purshyar temple, Sheshyar temple, Raghunath Mandir, Durga Patshala and Dhar temple. Gurdwaras are located in Rainawari, Amira Kadal, Jawahar Nagar, Mehjoor Nagar, Shaheed Gunj, Maharajpur and Indra Nagar areas of the city. There are three Christian churches in Srinagar. The Sheikh Bagh Cemetery is a Christian cemetery located in Srinagar that dates from the British colonial era. The oldest grave in the cemetery is that of a British colonel from the 9th Lancers of 1850 and the cemetery is valued for the variety of persons buried there which provides an insight into the perils faced by British colonisers in India. It was damaged by floods in 2014. It contains a number of war graves.The notable interments here are Robert Thorpe and Jim Borst. Rivers have long held profound significance in the religious and cultural landscapes of human societies, serving as conduits of spiritual expression, purification, and reverence. Among these sacred waterways, the Jhelum River, flowing through the heartlands of South Asia, stands as a symbol of religious sanctity and cultural heritage deeply ingrained in the beliefs and practices of the people who dwell along its banks.</p>

                    <p>In the tapestry of Hindu mythology and folklore, the Jhelum River occupies a prominent place, its waters intertwined with the narratives of ancient epics and revered as a sacred lifeline. Mentioned in the Rigveda, one of the oldest scriptures of Hinduism, the river is bestowed with mythological significance, believed to possess purifying properties and revered as a goddess embodying the divine feminine essence. Legends from the Mahabharata, including the epic Battle of Hydaspes where the valiant King Porus faced Alexander the Great, further enshrine the river's legacy in Hindu lore, depicting it as a witness to heroic deeds and the eternal struggle between dharma and adharma. Similarly, within the Islamic tradition, the Jhelum River holds a place of reverence and spiritual significance, particularly among the Muslim communities inhabiting the regions of Pakistan through which it flows. As followers of Islam engage in the act of ablution, the ritual purification preceding prayers, the river's waters are often sought for their symbolic cleansing power, embodying the divine mercy and grace believed to flow through the natural world. Alongside its practical utility as a source of sustenance and irrigation, the Jhelum River serves as a spiritual conduit, connecting believers with the transcendent realm and fostering a sense of unity with the natural order. Moreover, the Jhelum River embodies the syncretic spirit of South Asian religious traditions, where Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh influences converge to create a rich tapestry of beliefs and practices. Along its banks, sacred sites and shrines dedicated to saints and mystics abound, serving as focal points for interfaith dialogue and communal worship. Here, devotees from diverse religious backgrounds come together to pay homage to the shared heritage of the land, transcending sectarian divides in a celebration of spiritual unity and coexistence. Beyond its religious symbolism, the Jhelum River carries ecological and environmental significance, sustaining diverse ecosystems and providing vital resources for human livelihoods. In this interconnected web of life, the river's life-giving waters serve as a reminder of humanity's intrinsic bond with the natural world, calling upon individuals to act as stewards of the environment and guardians of its sacred gifts. In conclusion, the religious significance of the Jhelum River transcends mere geographical boundaries, weaving together a tapestry of spiritual beliefs and cultural practices that enrich the fabric of South Asian society. As a sacred conduit connecting the terrestrial realm with the divine, the river serves as a source of inspiration, renewal, and reverence for countless generations, embodying the timeless wisdom of the ages and the enduring</p>

                    <p>Nestled amidst the rugged terrain of the Himalayas and the serene landscapes of the Indian subcontinent, the Jhelum River basin emerges as a cradle of life, culture, and civilization, sustaining diverse ecosystems and nurturing the livelihoods of millions. Spanning across the picturesque regions of India and Pakistan, this ancient waterway serves as a lifeline, shaping the socio-economic fabric of the communities it touches and embodying the timeless rhythms of nature's bounty.

                        The Jhelum River, originating from the pristine glacial melts of the Himalayas, embarks on a majestic journey through the verdant valleys and rocky gorges of Kashmir, cascading through breathtaking landscapes and meandering its way towards the plains below. As it traverses the undulating terrain, the river transforms the arid expanses into oases of fertility, bestowing upon the land the gift of water and sustenance.
                        
                        At the heart of the Jhelum River basin lies its hydrological significance, as the river and its tributaries form a vast network of watercourses that irrigate agricultural lands, provide drinking water, and support various industries across the region. The waters of the Jhelum River have long been harnessed for hydroelectric power generation, driving the wheels of progress and facilitating economic development in the surrounding areas.
                        
                        Moreover, the Jhelum River basin serves as a crucible of biodiversity, harboring a rich tapestry of flora and fauna that thrive in its riparian habitats and wetland ecosystems. From the majestic Himalayan peaks to the tranquil marshlands of the Indus Delta, the basin encompasses a mosaic of habitats that support a myriad of species, including endangered mammals, avifauna, and aquatic life forms. Conservation efforts aimed at preserving the ecological integrity of the Jhelum River basin are thus paramount, safeguarding the fragile balance between human needs and environmental sustainability.
                        
                        Beyond its ecological significance, the Jhelum River basin is steeped in cultural heritage and historical legacies that resonate with the echoes of bygone eras. From the ancient civilizations of the Indus Valley to the medieval empires of Kashmir, the basin has been witness to the ebb and flow of human endeavors, bearing the imprints of diverse cultures, traditions, and architectural marvels. Temples, mosques, and shrines dot the landscape, serving as monuments to faith and resilience, while the folklore and oral traditions of the region evoke a sense of nostalgia and belonging among its inhabitants.
                        
                        However, the Jhelum River basin also faces myriad challenges in the modern era, ranging from water scarcity and pollution to climate change and geopolitical tensions. Rapid urbanization and industrialization have exerted immense pressure on the river's resources, leading to degradation of water quality and loss of biodiversity. Moreover, transboundary disputes and competing demands for water resources have exacerbated tensions between riparian states, necessitating collaborative efforts towards sustainable water management and conflict resolution.</p>

                    <p>That these treatment plants are urgently needed is not in doubt. The concentration of nitrate-nitrogen in the river has increased from 185 to 672μgL−1, indicating an increase of 260% over the years, reveals a study, ‘Massive land system changes impact water quality of the Jhelum River in Kashmir Himalaya’ published by Shakil Roomshoo, Irfan Rashid and others, assessing changes in water quality from 1983 to now.

                        This, according to the study, has happened due to the combined impact of urbanization, reckless application of pesticides and fertilizers, forest degradation and deforestation. The study adds that aquatic vegetation in lakes and wetlands has gone up by 110% during the past four decades, thereby affecting the health of socio-economically and ecologically important ecosystems.
                        
                        While settlements have shown a 397% increase in the observation period, 18% of the forested area in Jhelum’s catchment has degraded into sparse forest or scrublands from 1972 to 2010. Areas under croplands have decreased by 24% as people shifted from irrigation-intensive agriculture to orchard farming.</p>
