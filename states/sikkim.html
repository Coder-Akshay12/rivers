                    <p>Teesta River originates from the Tso Lhamo Lake at an elevation of about 5280 m in the North Sikkim district. It is the right bank major tributary of the Brahmaputra river system. Like many other major Himalayan rivers of India, like the Ganga, Teesta is a glacier-fed river. Pahurni glacier, Khangse glacier and ChhoLhamo Lake are also considered the sources of the Teesta River.</p>

                    <p>Teesta River is a 414 km (257 mi) long river that rises in the Pauhunri Mountain of eastern Himalayas, flows through the Indian states of Sikkim and West Bengal and subsequently enters Bangladesh through Rangpur division. In Bangladesh, it merges with Brahmaputra River which after meeting some other major rivers of the Bengal delta finally falls into the Bay of Bengal.It drains an area of 12,540 km2 (4,840 sq mi).In India, the Teesta flows through Mangan District, Gangtok District, Pakyong District, Kalimpong district, Darjeeling District, Jalpaiguri District, Cooch Behar districts and the cities of Rangpo, Jalpaiguri and Mekhliganj. In Bangladesh, it flows through Lalmonirhat District, Rangpur District, Kurigram District and Gaibandha District. It joins the Brahmaputra River at Phulchhari Upazila in Bangladesh. 305 km (190 mi) of the river lies in India and 109 km (68 mi) in Bangladesh. The Teesta is the largest river of Sikkim and second largest river of West Bengal after the Ganges.

                    <p>Mother Teesta: The Remover of Diseases:The  Teesta  River  is  also  worshiped  by  the  Hindu  Napalese.  They  call  the  river  goddess TeestaMaai,  literally  Mother  Teesta.  Sarat  Chandra  Mitra  (1931)  informs  us  about  the  worship  of Teesta  Maai  in  Jalpaiguri.  While  staying  in  Jalpaiguri,  he  witnessed  the  worship  of  the  river goddess by a Nepalese servant. The servant, as shown by Mitra, was ill, and when he recovered from  illness,  he  took  a  vow  to  worship  the  goddess  as  a  gesture  of  gratitude  (p.  209).  Charu Chandra  Sanyal  (1965)  also  opined  that  Teesta  Budi  worship  is  done  by the  Rajbanshis  to remove evil spirits that may cause diseases (p. 145).One of the most important reasons for the worship of Teesta Budi,  as shown by  Girija Shankar Roy  (1975),  is  the  warding  off  of  diseases  (p.  102).  Citing  examples  from  different  parts  of Lower  Bengal,  Mitra  (1931)  argued  that  similar  traditions  of  worship  where  people  often  take vows to do something in return for a favor from the deity are a common practice (p. 210). Every year on Poush Sankranti, people assemble at Beni or Tribeni, 72 kilometers from Darjeeling, to propitiate Teesta Maai by making animal sacrifices (De., 598). The place is considered sacred as a Sangam,  or  conjunction,  where  the  rivers  Teesta  and  Rangeet  met.  And  as  argued  by  Gupta (1984),  the  Hindu  scriptures  advocate  bathing  in  the Sangamas  it  leads  to  salvation,  and  the people around the hills as well as the plains came here to achieve salvation.</p>

                    <p>The Teesta River Basin is situated in the northeastern part of India, primarily in the state of Sikkim, as well as parts of West Bengal and the Indian-administered territory of the state of West Bengal. The Teesta River originates in the Himalayas and flows through the states of Sikkim and West Bengal before entering Bangladesh, where it eventually merges with the Brahmaputra River.

                    <p>In one of the most distressing episodes of environmental disasters seen in India, the north-eastern state of Sikkimâ€™s Teesta River reached its highest water level ever due to intense rainfall and thunderstorms in parts of the state. On Thursday morning, the news reported  that fourteen individuals lost their lives, and that 102 people, including a minimum of 23 Army personnel, remain unaccounted for in Sikkim. This tragic incident unfolded after the bursting of the South Lhonak Lake, a glacial lake located in the northwest of the state at an elevation of 17,000 feet. The lake burst due to relentless rainfall, leading to the release of water downstream. This surge of water resulted in the elevation of water levels in the Teesta River, and on October 4, the Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority (SSDMA) reported that this caused flooding in at least four districts, namely Mangan, Gangtok, Pakyong, and Namchi.. This has resulted in extensive damage from landslides and flooding. According to the most recent reports, about 25 army vehicles, portions of the ATTC college, and army personnel have been swept away in the resulting catastrophe.</p>
