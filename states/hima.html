                        The Chenab River is a major river that flows in India and Pakistan, and is one of the 5 major rivers of the Punjab region. It is formed by the union of two headwaters, Chandra and Bhaga, which rise in the upper Himalayas in the Lahaul region of Himachal Pradesh, India. The Chenab flows through the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir, India into the plains of Punjab, Pakistan, before ultimately flowing into the Indus River.

The waters of the Chenab were allocated to Pakistan under the terms of the Indus Waters Treaty. India is allowed non-consumptive uses such as power generation. The Chenab River is extensively used in Pakistan for irrigation. Its waters are also transferred to the channel of the Ravi River via numerous link canals. The Battle of Chenab was fought on the bank of the river

                    <p>The river was known to Indians in the Vedic period. In 325 BCE, Alexander the Great allegedly founded the town of Alexandria on the Indus (present-day Uch Sharif or Mithankot or Chacharan in Pakistan) at the confluence of the Indus and the combined streams of Punjab rivers (currently known as the Panjnad River).[18] Arrian, in the Anabasis of Alexander, quotes the eyewitness Ptolemy Lagides as writing that the river is 2 miles wide where Alexander crossed it.The river is formed by the confluence of two rivers, Chandra and Bhaga, at Tandi, 8 km (5.0 mi) southwest of Keylong, in the Lahaul and Spiti district of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh.[3]

                        The Bhaga river originates from Surya taal lake, which is situated a few kilometers west of the Bara-lacha la pass in Himachal Pradesh. The Chandra river originates from glaciers east of the same pass (near Chandra Taal). This pass also acts as a water-divide between these two rivers. The Chandra river transverses 115 km (71 mi) while the Bhaga river transverses 60 km (37 mi) through narrow gorges before their confluence at Tandi.
                        
                        The Chandra-Bhaga then flows through the Chamba district in Himachal Pradesh before entering the Jammu division of Jammu and Kashmir, where it flows through the Kishtwar, Doda, Ramban, Reasi and Jammu districts. It enters Pakistan and flows through the Punjab province before emptying into the Sutlej, forming the Panjnad river.

                    <p>The religious significance of the Chenab River often fosters a sense of stewardship and responsibility for its protection and preservation among local communities. This can lead to initiatives for environmental conservation, such as tree plantation drives, clean-up campaigns, and efforts to prevent pollution and habitat degradation along the riverbanks.The Chenab River plays a significant role in religious rituals and ceremonies conducted by local communities. Devotees perform rituals such as offering prayers, lighting lamps, and conducting religious processions along the riverbanks. Festivals and fairs held near the river celebrate its sacredness and cultural significance, fostering a sense of community and spiritual connection among devotees. Like many rivers in India, the Chenab River is steeped in mythology and folklore. According to local beliefs, the river is associated with various mythological stories and legends, which contribute to its revered status among devotees. Its pristine waters are often mentioned in ancient scriptures and texts, linking it to mythological events and deities.</p>

                    <p>The river Chenab (or Chandra Bhaga) is formed after the two streams the Chandra and the Bhaga merge with each other. The Chandra and the Bhaga originate from the south-west and north-west faces of Barelacha pass respectively in the Himalayan canton of Lahul and Spiti valley in Himachal Pradesh. The Chandra initially flowing southeast for about 88 kms. sweeps round the base of the mid-Himalayas and joins the Bhaga at Tandi, after traversing a total length of about 125 kms. The course of Bhaga upto the confluence is 80 kms only having a steep slope with an average fall of about 24 metres per kilometer. Thereafter the united stream, known as the Chenab or Chandra Bhaga, flows in a north-westerly course for about 46 kms where it receives its first major tributary the Miyar Nalla on the right bank. Then it flows for another 90 km generally in a northerly direction in Himachal Pradesh when it crosses the Pangi valley before entering to Padder area of Doda district of Jammu province in Jammu & Kashmir State. The river flows in a northwest direction in this reach for a distance of 56 km. when it is joined on the right by its biggest tributary, the Marusudar at Bhandalkot. Further Downstream, the river flows in a southerly direction for a distance of 34 km. upto Thathri and then takes a west ward course. In this reach about 17 kms downstream of Thathri, Niru Nallah joins the Chenab on its left bank. The river Chenab thereafter flows generally in a northwest direction for another 41 km. till it receives a tributary Bichleri on the right bank. Afterwards, the river traverses in a westerly direction for a distance of about 50 kms. In this reach a number of small streams join in, namely Chaini, Talsuen, and Ans on the right bank, Yabu Nallah, Mandial and Painthal Khad on the left bank. Downstream of Ans river confluence the river changes its direction and flows in southerly course for about 45 kms. upto Akhnoor where-after it enters into Sialkot district of Pakistan. Total length of the river from confluence of Chandra & Bhaga to Akhnoor is about 504 km.

The main tributaries in its passage upto Kishtwar are the Thirot, the Sohal, the Bhut nallah, the Liddrari and the Marusudar. The Marusudar is the biggest tributary of the Chenab and meets the Chenab at Bhandalkot. Between Kishtwar and Akhnoor, it receives the waters of the Kalnai, the Neeru, the Raghi, the Bichleri and the Ans. The Tawi and Manawar Tawi join Chenab in Pakistan.

                    <p>Salal Project: The Salal Project is a multipurpose project built on the Chenab River in the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Completed in 1987, the project includes a dam, reservoir, and powerhouse, with the primary objectives of hydropower generation, flood control, and irrigation. The project provides irrigation water to agricultural lands in the Chenab basin, contributing to agricultural development in the region.

                        Dulhasti Project: The Dulhasti Project is another multipurpose project located on the Chenab River in the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Completed in 2007, the project comprises a dam, reservoir, and powerhouse, generating hydroelectric power and providing irrigation water to agricultural lands in the Chenab basin. The project has helped in improving agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods in the region.</p>

                    <p>Construction of dams, barrages, and reservoirs for hydropower generation, irrigation, and flood control alters the natural hydrology of the Chenab River. These infrastructure projects regulate flow, change sediment transport patterns, and disrupt the river's ecosystem, affecting aquatic life and downstream communities.Deforestation in the catchment area of the Chenab River leads to soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and habitat degradation. The removal of vegetation exacerbates erosion, increases sedimentation in the river, and disrupts the ecological balance, threatening the survival of plant and animal species dependent on the river ecosystem.</p>
