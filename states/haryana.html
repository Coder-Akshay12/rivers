                <p>The Satluj River is the longest of the five rivers that flow through the historic crossroads region of Punjab in northern India and Pakistan. The Sutlej River is also known as Satadru. It is the easternmost tributary of the Indus River. The Bhakra Dam is built around the river Sutlej to provide irrigation and other facilities to the states of Punjab, Rajasthan and Haryana.The waters of the Sutlej are allocated to India under the Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan, and are mostly diverted to irrigation canals in India like the Sirhind Canal, Bhakra Main Line and the Rajasthan canal. The mean annual flow is 14 million acre feet (MAF) (roughly 1.727 × 1013 L) upstream of Ropar barrage, downstream of the Bhakra dam.It has several major hydroelectric points, including the 1,325 MW Bhakra Dam, the 1,000 MW Karcham Wangtoo Hydroelectric Plant, and the 1,500 MW Nathpa Jhakri Dam.[unreliable source?] The drainage basin in India includes the states and union territories of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Ladakh and Haryana.</p>

            <p>The Upper Sutlej Valley, called Langqên Zangbo in Tibet, was once known as the Garuda Valley by the Zhangzhung, the ancient civilization of western Tibet. The Garuda Valley was the centre of their empire, which stretched many miles into the nearby Himalayas. The Zhangzhung built a towering palace in the Upper Sutlej Valley called Kyunglung, the ruins of which still exist today near the village of Moincêr, southwest of Mount Kailash (Mount Ti-se). Eventually, the Zhangzhung were conquered by the Tibetan Empire. The Sutlej River also formed the eastern boundary of the Sikh Empire under Maharajah Ranjit Singh.Today, the Sutlej Valley is inhabited by nomadic descendants of the Zhangzhung, who live in tiny villages of yak herders.[citation needed] The Sutlej was the main medium of transportation for the kings of that time. In the early 18th century, it was used to transport devdar woods for Bilaspur district, Hamirpur district, and other places along the Sutlej's banks.[citation needed] Of four rivers (Indus, Sutlej, Brahmaputra and Karnali/Ganges) mythically flowing out of holy Lake Manasarovar, the Sutlej is actually connected by channels that are dry most of the time. Earlier the river was also called Shutudri or Zaradros river</p>

            <p>A large number of devotees worshipped the Sun God on the banks of Sutlej river and other water bodies in Phagwara, Goraya, Phillaur, Bilga, Noormahal and Nakodar during the last day of four-day Chhath festival today.People rushed to river banks, ponds and other water bodies, to offer ‘arghya’ to the setting and rising Sun. Devotees observed fast and arranged traditional puja offerings — ‘thekua’, coconut, banana and other seasonal fruits — in bamboo trays. Several political and social leaders such as Phagwara MLA Som Parkash, former minister Joginder Singh Maan, Congress leader Balbir Raja Sodhi, Gurwinder Singh Atwal, Santokh Singh, Jarnail Nangal ,Gurpartap Singh Wadhala and Amarjit Singh Samra said greeted the devotees and described Chhath as a festival of prosperity and joy. Elaborate arrangements were made for devotees on the occasion.
                <br>
                A Hindu anecdote stated that a king was cured of leprosy after he observed fast and offered ‘arghya’ to the Sun. This marked the beginning of the festival. The puja is performed to thank the Sun God for health and prosperity. About 35,000 migrants, mostly from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, performed the Chhath Puja on Sunday by offering ‘ark’ to the setting Sun along the Chachoki distributary in Phagwara. Thousands others performed puja along the Sutlej at Phillaur.Water was streamed down in the Chachoki canal especially for the occasion. The canal had been dry for the past several years.Political bigwigs had reportedly approached the Irrigation Department for securing the flow of water in the distributary in a bid to win over the migrants. Chhath is one of the most important festivals for the people of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

            <p>The Sutlej river basin is said to have a hydro-power potential of almost 10,000 MW, which if realized will result in bumper-to-bumper projects in the valley. We have attempted through the maps below, to plot each of these – large and small – projects in different stages of planning and execution.Here’s an interactive map that enables users to sift through the projects based on their size and clearance stage. Over time we hope to add more layers to this map as we process the amount of agriculture and forest land diverted to these projects, the number of affected villages, and other dimensions. The idea is to create a broad picture of the nature of this frenzied development, its magnitude, and its impact.The Sutlej river, originating from the Tibetan plateau, serves as the primary lifeline of the river basin. It enters Punjab at Bhakra, Rupnagar, and ultimately joins the Indus river in Pakistan via Harike, Ferozepur. The river’s flow, around 21 cubic kilometres of water annually, is a complex blend sourced from rain, snow, and glaciers. Nearly 60% of the flow into Bhakra comes from snow and glaciers, rapid melting and thinning of which are worrying. The glacier volume decreased by 21% from 1984 to 2013</p>

            <p><h3>Bhakra-Nangal Project:</h3> This is one of the largest multipurpose river valley projects in India, located on the Sutlej River in the states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. The project comprises the Bhakra Dam and the Nangal Dam, along with associated infrastructure. It provides irrigation water to a vast command area in Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan, supporting agriculture and contributing to the Green Revolution in India.
                <br>
                <h3>Thein Dam Project:</h3> Also known as the Ranjit Sagar Dam, this project is located on the Ravi River, which is a tributary of the Sutlej River, in the state of Punjab, India. The dam serves multiple purposes, including hydroelectric power generation, irrigation, and flood control. It provides irrigation water to agricultural lands in Punjab and helps in managing floodwaters during the monsoon season.

        <div class="text">
            <p> The construction of dams and hydropower projects on the Sutlej River and its tributaries alters river flow regimes, disrupts aquatic habitats, and impacts downstream water availability. Large dams, such as the Bhakra Dam and the Thein Dam, have social, environmental, and economic implications for local communities and ecosystems.The Sutlej River originates in the Himalayas, where glaciers are retreating due to climate change. Glacial melt contributes to increased water flow in the short term but may lead to reduced water availability in the long term, affecting river ecology, agriculture, and hydropower generation.</p>
