                        Kanyakumari (The Virgin (or Kanya) Princess' referring to Devi Kanya Kumari), officially Kanniyakumari, also known as Cape Comorin, is a city in Kanyakumari district in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. It is the southernmost tip of the Indian subcontinent and the southernmost city in mainland India, and thus referred to as "The Land's End". The city is situated 90 kilometres (56 mi) south of Thiruvananthapuram city, and about 20 kilometres (12 mi) south of Nagercoil, the headquarters of Kanyakumari district.

Kanyakumari is a popular tourist destination and pilgrimage centre in India. Notable tourist spots include its unique sunrise and sunset points, the 41-metre (133 ft) Thiruvalluvar Statue, and Vivekananda Rock Memorial off the coast.[1] Lying at the tip of peninsular India, the town is bordered on the west, south, and east by the Laccadive Sea.[2] It has a coastline of 71.5 kilometres (44.4 mi) stretched along these three sides

                    <p>The place derives its name from the goddess Kanya Kumari, considered to be the sister of Krishna. The goddess is believed to remove the rigidity from the mind, and women pray for marriage at her temple. In 1656, the Dutch East India Company conquered Portuguese Ceylon from the Portuguese East Indies, and the name eventually corrupted to "Comorin" and was called "Cape Comorin" during British rule in India. In 2016, the town and its district were renamed to "Kanniyakumari" by the Government of India and the Government of MadrasAccording to a Hindu legend, Kanya Devi, an avatar of Parvati, was to marry Shiva, who failed to show up on his wedding day. Rice and other grains meant for the wedding feast remained uncooked and unused.[9] The uncooked grains turned into stones as time went by. Some believe that the small stones on the shore today, which look like rice, are indeed grains from the wedding that was never solemnised. Kanya Devi is now considered a virgin goddess who blesses pilgrims and tourists who flock to the town. Her temple in Kanyakumari is a Shakti Peetha: a holy shrine in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism.

                    <p>The Thiruvalluvar Statue is a 7,000-ton stone statue of poet and philosopher Valluvar. It has a height of 29 metres (95 feet) and stands upon an 11.5-metre (38 ft) rock that represents the 38 chapters of virtue in the Thirukkural. The statue standing on the rock represents wealth and pleasures, signifying that wealth and love be earned and enjoyed on the foundation of solid virtue.[22] The combined height of the statue and pedestal is 133 ft (40.5 m), denoting the 133 chapters in the Thirukkural.

                        The statue is reminiscent of a dancing pose of Nataraja. It was sculpted by the Indian sculptor V. Ganapati Sthapati, who also created the Iraivan Temple, and its opening ceremony was on 1 January 2000. The monument was hit by the Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 December 2004,[23] but stood unaffected. The statue is designed to survive earthquakes of high magnitude.[citation needed] During maintenance work, as well as during rough sea, entry is restricted for tourists.Bhagavathy Amman Temple is a 3,000-year-old temple dedicated to Goddess Kumari Amman located at Kanyakumari on the shore of the Laccadive Sea. Kumari Amman is one of the forms of Devi, popularly known as "Kumari Bhagavathy Amman". The temple is the first Durga temple created by Lord Parasurama and one of the 108 Shakthi Peethas. It is mentioned in the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Purananuru</p>

                    <p>The Pahrali River is one of the prominent rivers in Kanyakumari district, originating from the Western Ghats and flowing through the eastern part of the district. It eventually joins the Pazhayar River, which empties into the Bay of Bengal. The Pahrali River plays a crucial role in providing water for irrigation, domestic use, and supporting local ecosystems.Although not originating from Kanyakumari district, the Thamirabarani River is significant for the region as it flows through neighboring Tirunelveli district and serves as a major source of water. It originates in the Western Ghats and flows eastward, eventually emptying into the Gulf of Mannar. The Thamirabarani River basin supports agriculture, drinking water supply, and sustains biodiversity in the region.

                    <p>Lift Irrigation Schemes: Lift irrigation schemes are implemented in Kanyakumari district to lift water from nearby water sources such as rivers, streams, or reservoirs and distribute it to agricultural fields through a network of pipelines and canals. These schemes enable farmers to access water for irrigation, especially in areas where groundwater levels are low or unreliable.Check Dams and Percolation Ponds: Check dams and percolation ponds are constructed in various parts of Kanyakumari district to harvest rainwater and recharge groundwater. These structures help in retaining surface runoff, increasing soil moisture, and replenishing aquifers, thereby providing additional water resources for irrigation during dry periods.</p>

                    <p>Kanyakumari district experiences water scarcity, particularly during the dry season. The region receives moderate to low rainfall, and groundwater levels may decline due to over-extraction and inadequate recharge. Water scarcity affects agricultural productivity, household water supply, and other socio-economic activities.

                        Groundwater Depletion: Over-extraction of groundwater for irrigation, industrial, and domestic purposes has led to the depletion of groundwater levels in some parts of Kanyakumari district. Excessive groundwater pumping can result in saltwater intrusion in coastal areas, further exacerbating water quality issues and impacting agriculture and drinking water sources.</p>
