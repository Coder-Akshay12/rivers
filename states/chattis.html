                        The Indravati River is a stream of the river Godavari. Its starting point, found to be the Ghats of Dandakaranya, range from a hilltop village Mardiguda of Thuamula Rampur Block in the Kalahandi district of the state of Odisha. Due to the amalgamation of three streams, The River follows a westerly path and enters Jagadalpur in the state of Chhattisgarh. The river moves from here in a southern route, before eventually uniting with the Godavari at the borders of three states. They are the state of Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Telangana. The river at a variety of stages of its course forms the boundary between Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. The river Indravati is also known as the oxygen of the Bastar district of state of Chhattisgarh. This district is one of the greenest and eco-friendly districts, found in the whole of India. A total number of five hydroelectric projects were planned on the river Indravati. They were namely the Kutru I, the Kutro II, the Nugru I, Nugru II and the Bhopalpatnam. However, the plan misfired and did not see the light of the day due to ecological reasons. The Indravati is sometimes known as the "lifeline" of the Kalahandi, Nabarangapur, of Odisha & Bastar district of Chhattisgarh, one of the greenest districts in India.

                    <p>There is a Hindu mythological story behind the formation of Indravati River. Once upon a time the place was full of Champa and Chandan trees, which fragranced the whole forest. Due to such a beautiful place on earth, Lord Indra and Indrani went down from Heaven to stay here for a while. They deeply enjoyed the beauty of nature; while wandering in the jungle Indra went to a small village Sunabeda (Nuapada district), where he met with a beautiful girl Udanti. At first meet, they fall in love with each others; and Indra disagreed to get back. On other side, due to disband or separation Indrani cried sorrowfully and expressed her pain to the people, where gathered there. People knew well about the Indra and Udanti; they informed the same to Indrani and suggested to stay there. Indrani got irate over Indra and pour scorn on Indra and Udanti so that they never meet again and she stayed there as Indravati River, which flows till date. And, Indra and Udanti rivers are also flowing there separately, without meeting each other due to offense of Indrani.

The river's name, "Indravati," translates to "beloved of Indra," signifying its special connection to the divine.The Indravati River is not only a source of spiritual reverence but also a symbol of cultural heritage and identity for the people of central India. Folklore, legends, and traditional practices passed down through generations celebrate the river's significance, weaving it into the fabric of local customs, rituals, and festivals. The river's waters are often invoked in religious ceremonies, social gatherings, and cultural celebrations, reflecting the intimate relationship between humans and nature.Beyond its religious and cultural significance, the Indravati River plays a vital role in sustaining the rich biodiversity of the region. The river and its riparian habitats support a diverse array of plant and animal species, including endemic and migratory species, contributing to the ecological balance and ecosystem services in the area. Traditional conservation practices and community-based initiatives aim to preserve the river's natural heritage and promote sustainable stewardship of its resources.</p>

                    <p>he Indravati sub-basin covers a total area of about 40,625 square kms. Indravati has a catchment area of 7,435 square kms in Odisha. The length of river is about 535.80 kms , and starting from the hills of Kalahandi, it joins the Godavari river near village Bhadrakali in Bijapur district of Chhattisgarh. It has a well-defined course from its origin to its confluence with the Godavari River. Starting in a south-east direction as a small rivulet in Odisha, it later runs in western direction through Bastar district of Chhattisgarh until it is deflected and runs north-west and then again takes a turn to the south-west. During its total course of 535.80 kms the river drops by 832.10 metres. Its bed level at its junction with the Godavari River is of the order of R.L. 82.3 m compared to the level in Kalahandi from where it takes off is 914.4m.

                        Indravati and Sabari are interconnected naturally in Odisha area. Indravati waters overflow into the Sabari through Jaura nallah during floods.

                <div class="text">
                    <p>Pollution is a major threat to the water quality of the Indravati River and its tributaries. Industrial discharge, agricultural runoff containing pesticides and fertilizers, untreated sewage, and solid waste disposal contribute to high levels of contamination, degrading water quality and posing risks to aquatic life and public health. Pollution also affects the availability of clean drinking water for communities living along the riverbanks.Deforestation in the catchment area of the Indravati River contributes to soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and habitat degradation. The removal of vegetation exacerbates erosion, increases sedimentation in the river, and disrupts ecological balance, threatening the survival of plant and animal species dependent on the river ecosystem.</p>
