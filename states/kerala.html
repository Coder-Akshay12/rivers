                    <p>Periyar River, river in southern Kerala state, southwestern India. Periyar is also the name given to a lake in the river’s course. The river, 140 miles (225 km) long, rises in the Western Ghats range near the border with Tamil Nadu state and flows north a short distance to Periyar Lake. The lake, 12 square miles (31 square km) in area, is an artificial reservoir created by damming the river. It lies at an elevation of about 2,800 feet (850 meters), is ringed by mountain peaks, and is surrounded by a wildlife sanctuary. A tunnel carries water from the lake eastward through the mountains to the Vaigai River in Tamil Nadu, where it is used for irrigation.</P>

                <img src="/src/States rivers/kerla/his.jpeg">
                <p>The Periyar Valley was under the reign of the Pandyas who ruled from Madurai until the 12th century. In 1895, the Mullaperiyar dam was constructed. The dam, built across the west-flowing River Periyar, stops the river to form a reservoir. It also resulted in the creation of an artificial lake, which enhanced the charm of the valley. The lake, in the centre of the sanctuary, is the nucleus of the reserve and the place where the elephants and the avifauna come to frolic, to drink water and to cool themselves with dips in the hot months. down to play. By creating this artificial lake, the dam changed the landscape and the features of the valley drastically.
                    During the 18th and 19th centuries, the reserve was the hunting ground of the Travancore kings. The Kingdom of Travancore comprised most of modern-day southern Kerala, the district of Kanyakumari , and the southernmost parts of the neighboring state of Tamil Nadu. After India's independence, Travancore merged with Cochin to form Travancore-Cochin which again, some time later, joined with Malabar district of Madras State to form Kerala.
                    Inside the reserve was a palace - the Edapalayam Lake Palace - meant for the guests of the royal family. In 1899, the area was declared as a forest reserve called the Periyar Lake Reserve. This step was taken with the main intention of protecting the hunting area of the kings  from the encroachment of tea plantations.
                    In 1934, the lake reserve was converted into a game sanctuary, the Nellikkampatty Game Sanctuary, on the recommendation of S. C. H. Robinson, the first game warden. The game  sanctuary covered an area of about 500 sq km. In 1950, some more area was added to create the  Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary. In 1978, the sanctuary was included in the Central Government initiative known as Project Tiger and was renamed the Periyar Tiger Reserve.
                    Project Tiger, initiated in 1972 to protect the magnificent Bengal Tigers, aims at tiger conservation in specially chosen tiger reserves throughout the country. The Bengal tiger also known as Royal Bengal tiger - the national animal of India - is native to India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.
                    In 1992, it became part of Project Elephant. Project Elephant was launched by the Central  Ministry of Environment and Forests to protect the free ranging populations of wild Asian elephants in various Indian states.
                    Five years later, in 1996, the India Eco-Development Project too was launched in the reserve. In 2001, the sanctuary was reorganized into two divisions – Periyar East and Periyar West .
                    Today, the reserve houses at least 40 tigers and hundreds of elephants and its rich jungles with their fascinating biodiversity attract visitors throughout the year.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>There are several places of religious significance along the banks of the Periyar. The famous Aluva Sivarathri festival is celebrated on the banks of the Periyar River in Aluva.The temple festival is conducted every year on Sivarathri day of the Kumbham month of Malayalam calendar. The Siva temple on the sand bank of Periyar River throngs with devotees every year on Mahasivarathri day.

                        Kalady is a town located on the banks of the Periyar river. It is the birthplace of Sri Adi Shankara, the Hindu philosopher who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta. Kalady started featuring in the spiritual map of India only after its rediscovery in the late 19th century by the then Shankaracharya of Sringeri and the subsequent consecration of a temple for Sri Adi Shankara in 1910.
                        
                        Located 52 kilometres (32 mi) from Kochi, the Malayatoor Church is situated atop the 609-metre (1,998 ft) high Malayatoor Hill. The church is dedicated to St. Thomas, who is believed to have prayed at this shrine. One of the most important Christian pilgrim centres in Kerala, it attracts devotees in very large numbers not only from Kerala but also from the neighbouring states. This famous church is situated at Kurisumudi, a verdant hill in the Western Ghats girdled partially by the Periyar (river). The Church has a life-size statue of St. Thomas and the imprint of the feet of the Apostle on a rock. This shrine has now been accorded an international pilgrimage station.</p>

                <h1>RIVER BASIN</h1>
                <img src="/src/States rivers/kerla/basin.jpeg">
                <p>The Periyar basin spreads over an area of 5,398 square kilometres (2,084 sq mi), most of it in central Kerala. It lies between latitudes 9°15’30"N and 10°21’00"N and longitudes 76°08’38"E and 77°24’32"E. The river drains parts of Idukki, Ernakulam and Thrissur districts in Kerala and Coimbatore district in Tamil Nadu.The basin has an inverted "L" shape with a maximum width at the intersection. The length-width ratio is 6:1. Most of the streams flow in deep gorges with steep valleys along the highlands of the basin.Coming out of the hills, the Periyar flows west and its basin occupies the northern part of Ernakulam district, covering the region from Neriamangalam through Aluva to Varapuzha and Munambam.

                    The Periyar is an 8th order stream with considerable development of tributary network. The average drainage density of the basin is 2.46 km/ km2 with a total number of first order streams of 15,773. The total stream length inclusive of all orders in the basin is 13,291 kilometres (8,259 mi). The river originates from the high hills of the Western Ghats and the influence of tectonism can be evidenced from the stream pattern and presence of structural valleys. Forests occupy nearly 1,500 square kilometres (580 sq mi) (28%) of the basin area whereas cardamom and settlement with mixed tree crops occupy an area of 322 square kilometres (124 sq mi) and 2,176 square kilometres (840 sq mi) respectively. The basin is ecologically sensitive. Nearly 80% of the total area situated in the high ranges are susceptible to erosion and mass movements.
                    Anamudi, at 2,695 metres (8,842 ft) the highest peak in South India, is the highest point in the basin.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>The lower reaches of the Periyar are heavily polluted. Industries in the Eloor industrial zone discharge waste into the river. Greenpeace India describes the lower Periyar as "a cesspool of toxins, which have alarming levels of deadly poisons like DDT, endosulfan, hexa and trivalent chromium, lead, cyanide, BHC". Several studies have pointed out that the riverbed has deposits of heavy metals like lead, cadmium, mercury, chromium, nickel, cobalt and zinc and the ecosystem of the river has many dead zones. Some of the major recommendations are ensuring zero effluent discharge from the industrial units in the Eloor-Edayar stretch and zero emission from companies. Pollution of the river and surrounding wetlands has almost wiped out traditional occupations, including fishing and farming.</p>
                    Illegal sand mining from the Periyar is another major environmental issue. Studies have pointed out that the quantity of sand being mined from the Periyar is at least 30 times the actual quantity that can be taken out without causing damage to the river’s environmental system. In the Periyar river basin, land sand mining is widespread in the plateau region in the highlands. Mining of sands from these areas impose severe environmental problems to the river basin environment.
