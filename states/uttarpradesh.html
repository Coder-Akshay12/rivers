                        The Yamuna  is the second-largest tributary river of the Ganges by discharge and the longest tributary in India. Originating from the Yamunotri Glacier at a height of about 4,500 m (14,800 ft)[1] on the southwestern slopes of Bandarpunch peaks of the Lower Himalaya in Uttarakhand, it travels 1,376 kilometres (855 mi) and has a drainage system of 366,223 square kilometres (141,399 sq mi), 40.2% of the entire Ganges Basin. It merges with the Ganges at Triveni Sangam, Prayagraj , which is a site of the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival held every 12 years.Like the Ganges, the Yamuna is highly venerated in Hinduism and worshipped as the goddess Yamuna. In Hinduism, she is believed to be the daughter of the sun god, Surya, and the sister of Yama, the god of death, and so she is also known as Yami. According to popular Hindu legends, bathing in Yamuna's sacred waters frees one from the torments of death.

Her mythical origins add to her significance in Hindu culture.The river played a crucial role in the growth and development of ancient civilizations in the region. It served as a lifeline for trade and agriculture, with several historical cities and settlements flourishing along its banks.
                        Historical sites such as Agra, Mathura, and Vrindavan, located on the Yamuna's course, have deep-rooted connections to Indian history and culture.

                    <p>The Yamuna River is revered as a goddess, known as Yamuna Devi or Yamunaji, and is worshipped by millions of Hindus. Pilgrims consider bathing in its waters a purifying and spiritually uplifting experience.
                        The river is closely associated with Lord Krishna, one of the most revered deities in Hinduism. Krishna spent his childhood and youth in the region along the Yamuna's banks, particularly in Vrindavan and Mathura. His divine and playful activities in these areas have become the stuff of legend and are celebrated in Hindu texts and festivals.The Yamuna River is the backdrop for numerous Hindu rituals and ceremonies. Pilgrims from across India visit the river to perform ablutions, seek blessings, and offer prayers.
                        Festivals like Karthik Purnima, during which lamps and diyas are floated on the river, and Yam Dwitiya, celebrating the bond between brothers and sisters, are observed with great fervor along the Yamuna's banks.</p>

                    <p>The river flows southwards for about 200 kilometres (120 mi), through the Lower Himalayas and the Shivalik Hills Range. Morainic deposits are found along the steep Upper Yamuna, highlighted with geomorphic features such as interlocking spurs, steep rock benches, gorges and stream terraces. Large terraces formed over a long period of time can be seen in the lower course of the river, such as those near Naugoan. An important part of its early catchment area, totalling 2,320 square kilometres (900 sq mi), lies in Himachal Pradesh. The Tons, Yamuna's largest tributary, drains a large portion of the upper catchment area and holds more water than the main stream. It rises from the Hari-ki-dun valley and merges after Kalsi near Dehradun. The drainage system of the river stretches between Giri-Sutlej catchment in Himachal and Yamuna-Bhilangna catchment in Garhwal, also draining the ridge of Shimla. Kalanag (6,387 metres [20,955 ft]) is the highest point of the Yamuna basin. Other tributaries in the region are the Giri, Rishi Ganga Kunta, Hanuman Ganga and Bata, which drain the upper catchment area of the Yamuna basin.
                        The Yamuna defines the state borders between Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and between Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. When the Yamuna reaches the Indo-Gangetic plain, it runs almost parallel to the Ganges, the two rivers creating the Ganges-Yamuna Doab region. Spread across 69,000 square kilometres (27,000 sq mi), one-third of the alluvial plain, the region is known for its agricultural output, particularly for the cultivation of basmati rice. The plain's agriculture supports one-third of India's population

These projects include dams, barrages, and reservoirs constructed on the Yamuna's tributaries, such as the Tons, Giri, and Ganga rivers. The reservoirs created by these projects provide water for irrigation, hydropower generation, and other purposes downstream.</p>

                    <p>In recent decades, the Yamuna River has faced severe pollution due to industrial discharge and untreated sewage. This pollution has threatened its ecological balance and raised concerns about its sacred waters.
                        Conservation efforts and initiatives have been launched to address the pollution and restore the river to its pristine state, highlighting its enduring importance in Indian culture and the need to protect it for future generations.</p>
