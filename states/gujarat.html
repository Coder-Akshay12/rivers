                    <p>The Mahi river rises in the western Vindhya Range, just south of Sardarpur, and flows northward through Madhya Pradesh state. Turning northwest, it enters Rajasthan state and then turns southwest to flow through Gujarat state through the north of Vadodara city outskirts and enters the sea by a wide estuary before Khambhat[2] after about a 360-mile (580-km) course. The silt brought down by the Mahi has contributed to the shallowing of the Gulf of Khambhat and the abandonment of its once-prosperous ports. The riverbed lies considerably lower than the land level and is of little use for irrigation.

                        The river is worshipped by many people and has many temples and places of worship along its shore. It is popularly described as Mahisagar due to the vastness of the river. The newly formed Mahisagar district in Gujarat derives its name from this pious river. This river crosses the Tropic of Cancer twice.[3]

                    <p>The history of the Mahi River dates back to ancient times, with archaeological evidence suggesting human habitation along its banks as far back as the Indus Valley Civilization. The river's fertile plains and abundant water resources attracted early settlers, who established thriving agricultural communities and trading centers along its course.During the medieval period, the Mahi River played a strategic role in the rise and fall of empires and kingdoms in central India. It served as a natural barrier and boundary between rival powers, shaping the political landscape of the region. The river's strategic importance led to the construction of forts, bridges, and defensive structures along its banks, which served to protect and control the territories on either side.The Mahi River served as a vital lifeline for trade and commerce, facilitating the exchange of goods and commodities between different regions of India. The river was navigable for small boats and barges, allowing merchants to transport goods such as grains, spices, textiles, and metals along its waterways. Trade flourished in bustling riverine towns and ports, which emerged as centers of economic activity and cultural exchange.The Mahi River basin is steeped in cultural heritage, with a rich tapestry of art, architecture, and folklore woven into its landscapes. Temples, shrines, and sacred sites dedicated to Hindu gods and goddesses dot the riverbanks, reflecting the spiritual beliefs and practices of the local communities. Festivals, fairs, and religious ceremonies held along the river celebrate its sacredness and significance in the cultural life of the people.

                    <p>The Mahi basin extends over states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat having total area of 34,842 Sq.km with a maximum length and width of about 330 km and 250 km. It lies between 72°21’ to 75°19’ east longitudes and 21°46’ to 24°30’ north latitudes. It is bounded by Aravalli hills on the north and the north-west, by Malwa Plateau on the east, by the Vindhyas on the south and by the Gulf of Khambhat on the west. Mahi is one of the major interstate west flowing rivers of India. It originates from the northern slopes of Vindhyas at an altitude of 500 m near village Bhopawar, Sardarpur tehsil in Dhar district of Madhya Pradesh. The total length of Mahi is 583 km. The Som is its principal tributary which joins from right, and the Anas and the Panam joins the river from left. It drains into the Arabian Sea through the Gulf of Khambhat. The major part of basin is covered with agricultural land accounting to 63.63% of the total area and 4.34% of the basin is covered by water bodies. The basin spreads over 11 parliamentary constituencies (2009) comprising 6 of Gujarat, 3 of Rajasthan, and 2 of Madhya Pradesh.

                    <p>Kadana Dam: The Kadana Dam is a multipurpose project built on the Mahi River in Gujarat. Completed in 1979, it serves several purposes, including irrigation, hydropower generation, and flood control. The dam has a reservoir capacity of over 1 billion cubic meters and supplies water for irrigation to agricultural lands in the region.</p>
                        <br>
                        Mahi Canal Project: The Mahi Canal Project is a major irrigation initiative in Gujarat, which diverts water from the Mahi River to irrigate agricultural lands in the surrounding areas. The project includes the construction of canals, weirs, and check dams to distribute water efficiently and sustainably to farms and fields.<br>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>: Pollution is a major threat to the water quality of the Mahi River. Industrial effluents, agricultural runoff containing pesticides and fertilizers, untreated sewage, and solid waste disposal contribute to high levels of contamination, degrading water quality and posing risks to aquatic life and public health. Pollution also affects the availability of clean drinking water for communities living along the riverbanks.Water allocation and distribution among different sectors, including agriculture, industry, and urban areas, often lead to conflicts among stakeholders in the Mahi River basin. Disputes over water rights, usage, and management require effective governance mechanisms and equitable solutions to ensure sustainable water use and minimize conflicts.</p>
